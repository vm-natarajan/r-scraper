"1","Companies offer heavy discounts on cars, SUVs as slowdown bites","NEW DELHI: It's not much of a festive season for car and SUV makers as the spike in fuel and insurance costs + as well as wealth destruction in the stock markets have dampened buyer sentiment, which is now delaying, or even putting off new purchases, replacements and upgrades. With inventory levels far above the average, companies have started throwing in massive discounts and other 'festive' offers to lure buyers and push sales.

Discounts are being offered on hatchbacks, sedans, and SUVs by companies, ranging from mass players such as Maruti Suzuki, Hyundai, Mahindra, Ford and Tata Motors, to luxury sellers like BMW, Audi and Mercedes-Benz. These offers range from Rs 50,000 on Maruti Alto mini, to Rs 70,000 on Mahindra Scorpio SUV, and going up to as high as Rs 14 lakh on BMW 7-Series saloon.

Going looks tough, even though the industry has managed to grow 7% in first half ending September 30 this fiscal. ""Sales have been muted due to factors such as low consumer sentiment + , high fuel prices and effects of monsoon in many parts of the country,"" Rajan Wadhera, head of industry body Siam and president of Mahindra & Mahindra's automotive division, said. ""People want to postpone purchases as running cost has shot up.""



Officials at Hyundai and Maruti agree. ""Sentiment remains weak. Apart from fuel and insurance costs, the recent political discourse in the run-up to the elections is also impacting buyer mood. As campaigning gets negative, buyers get apprehensive and unsure of future, and thus postpone big-ticket purchases,"" an official at Maruti told TOI.

YK Koo, MD & CEO of Hyundai India, said situation is ""not so healthy"". ""What is also troubling companies is the crash in the rupee, which has impacted our manufacturing costs. While our inputs are expensive, we cannot pass on the additional costs as sales are slow. Also, it is the festive period where people want lucrative deals."" RBI's Consumer Confidence Survey, released on October 5, said the consumer's perception on the general economic situation and employment scenario has worsened in September.


Rupee crashes to new record closing low of 74.06 against US dollar


Ravi G Bhatia, India president for global automotive data and consultancy firm JATO, said inventory levels at most of the dealerships remain ""substantially high"" and beyond average. ""While there has been a correction, inventory is still over 60 days for some companies. This is unhealthy."" Bhatia said dealers are also cautious in adding new inventory during year-end. ""With the model-year changing in 2019, no one wants to carry a large number of cars made in 2018 into the new year.""



Siam said forecast for this fiscal needs to be revised downward. ""While we had given a forecast of 9-11% at the beginning of this fiscal, growth is now expected only at the lower end,"" Wadhera said.


The situation remains grim even at the luxury-end where Mercedes-Benz saw a marginal decline in numbers. ""There is a liquidity crunch due to a cautious banking system, and traders and SMEs are not getting adequate funding to even meet business needs. Why would they replace or upgrade to an expensive car then?"" said one of the top luxury dealers in the national capital. ""The turmoil in the stock market has compounded the problem further. We do not expect the market to recover till the elections.""","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/companies-offer-heavy-discounts-on-cars-suvs-as-slowdown-bites/articleshow/66189391.cms"

"3","Elon Musk-led Tesla actually files trademark application for 'Teslaquila'","NEW DELHI: What started as an April Fools’ Day joke that left a poor taste in Tesla Inc investors’ mouths may soon become a reality.

The electric-car maker submitted a trademark application on October 8 for Teslaquila, describing the planned product as a distilled agave liquor. It was filed as “based on intent to use,” which means Tesla doesn’t have the product ready just yet. The company needs to actually be making a product to obtain the trademark.

Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the brand would be coming soon. Musk also posted a mock-up of roughly what the tequila bottle will look like.

"4","#MeToo: Companies rush to sensitise employees","MUMBAI: The #MeToo movement has resulted in a sudden surge in the number of organisations rushing to firms providing training solutions for sensitising the workforce and internal complaints committee (ICC) members to be fully compliant with the law on Prevention of Sexual Harassment at the Workplace (POSH).
Companies hastening to download material on the law and training modules in the last few days actually crashed the website of one such training solutions provider, Rainmaker.

Antony Alex CEO, Rainmaker, said: “We had built a robust website that could handle a large volume of traffic. However, over the last few days, the volumes dramatically spiked and many thousands of people were constantly trying to download free materials and posters on POSH, which we had created to sensitise and train employees as well as ICC members. Our website couldn’t handle the load and it crashed, for the first time since we started this business. Our IT team worked overnight to get it up and running.”


(The number of cases of sexual harassment being reported by 44 Nifty companies — a mandatory requirement in their annual reports — has gone up by over 48% in the last four years.)

A four-year-old firm, Rainmaker has seen a near 200% spike in the number of queries it has received over the last one week. The firm expects to clock a 250% jump in turnover this fiscal and the #MeToo movement would have a major part to play.

Cohere Consultants, a specialist in this field, is also seeing the number of queries growing by the day. Devika Singh, Cohere’s lead legal consultant & NGO founder, said sexual harassment inquiries and litigation are a great business opportunity. She said she has been receiving a lot of enquiries from lawyers who want to start of in this field.

“Right now with #MeToo, most companies have gone into a panic mode. There is a rush for trainings for employees on POSH,” said Singh, while adding that in dealing with sexual harassment cases, what’s required is empathetic listening to make the woman comfortable. “Such cases are not just a matter of documentation and legal processes. It’s largely about handling a person in trauma and two people who are in conflict in a system that may not be supportive in subtle ways due to deeply entrenched patriarchy,” said Singh, who holds training sessions for lawyers and ICC members on empathetic listening.

Complykaro Services founder and director Vishal Kedia said companies are reaching out to understand whether aggrieved women can make such complaints after several years and want to know the legal implications of non-compliance.

Over the last few days, small- and mid-sized companies have approached Rainmaker to set their house in order by training their ICC. “Some of the companies who earlier ignored our pitches are returning calls and are keen on conducting workshops for ICC members and sensitising their workforce,” said Alex, who has also taken on some clients free of charge to create awareness.

Singh said although there are limitations in the law that gives an outer period of 6 months within which a complaint needs to be lodged with the ICC, companies are asking whether anything can be done morally to help the woman.




Out of the 1,000-plus cases that Cohere Consultants has handled, Singh said complaints are the last resort as women make attempts to first ignore such behaviour, then avoid it, then compromise with it or try to fix it in indirect ways. “In 70% of the cases, the complainants’ ask is not that the harasser be removed from employment. In fact, most victims are so concerned of further violence in the form of acid attacks and other hostility and retaliation not only from the harasser but also colleagues, that this is their least preferred option. The majority just asks that the harasser be made to understand that what he has done is wrong, that it not happen again with them and that the harasser not repeat it with any other women. It is only when that does not work that they look at complaining to the ICC. This happens In 29% of the cases, which is a growing segment,” said Singh.


The balance 1% of cases may be false cases. But, Singh said these get magnified beyond reason, creating several biases. “I recently got a briefing on a case from the HR of a company, telling me even before an investigation has been done that this appears to be a false case. What has led to the perception is that the case has come after the performance evaluation process. A drop in performance of a person who is being sexually harassed at the workplace is but natural. It’s a traumatic situation. In Australia, there is a discussion whether sexual harassment should be treated as a public health issue,” said Singh.


In most organisations, the line manager is usually the first person of contact for an aggrieved woman to go for redressal. However, training is usually not provided to managers on handling such sensitive issues. Finally, it depends on the maturity and discretion of the manager on how to handle such cases. “Unfortunately, we concentrate on training women employees to speak up but we don’t train managers to listen without judgment — empathetically and sensitively. As an extension of the employer, it is a managers’ responsibility to bring such issues to the notice of the concerned ICC. However, most managers shift this onus onto the aggrieved woman and even take comfort if it’s a verbal complaint by the woman employee who usually is not in the frame of mind to file a formal complaint or is very hesitant to. When a manager comes up with half-hearted solutions, it demotivates and isolates the complainant whose resentment builds up not only against the harasser but also the manager and hence the company itself and eventually she may take to social media to vent out,” said Singh.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/metoo-cos-rush-to-sensitise-employees/articleshow/66188489.cms"
"5","Window 'narrowing' for global economy, IMF warns","INDONESIA: The window of opportunity for safeguarding global growth is ""narrowing"" as trade disputes deepen and emerging markets face fiscal crisis, the IMF said on Saturday, warning countries against worsening things by weaponising currency and interest-rate policies.

US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had downplayed the global concerns expressed at an International Monetary Fund meeting held this week in Bali under the shadow of US-China tensions, saying the world would benefit if Beijing is forced to changes its trade policies.

But the IMF said in a communique that while global growth currently remained ""steady"", the risks are ""increasingly skewed to the downside amid heightened trade tensions and ongoing geopolitical concerns"".

The fund kicked off its annual meeting with the World Bank on the Indonesian resort island earlier in the week in a gloomy mood, preoccupied by the trade tussle between the world's two biggest economies, and tightening financial conditions faced by emerging markets.

On Tuesday, it cut its outlook for global GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 per cent for 2018 and 2019, citing the trade war.

""The window of opportunity (is) narrowing,"" the 189-country organisation said, adding that members would ""refrain from competitive (currency) devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes"" -- a line apparently aimed at the US and China.

Mnuchin this week said he had told the head of China's central bank about his concerns over the weakness of its currency.

US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of depreciating its currency to absorb the impact of US trade tariffs.

But Mnuchin, speaking on the Bali meeting's sidelines, declined to comment on whether Washington would declare Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" in a Treasury report due out next week.

That would be a first for China, triggering a process that could lead to punitive steps.

Mnuchin also pushed back against the growing global angst over the US-China trade fight, saying that pressuring Beijing into adopting more open trade policies would be good for all.

""Our objective with China is very clear: it's to have a more balanced trading relationship,"" he said.

""I think that if we are successful, this is very good for US companies, US workers, Europeans, Japan, all of our other allies, and good for China.""

The argument gained little traction in Bali on Saturday.

""Trade conflict would be bad for all economies, not just the US and China,"" Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda said.

""This type of thing will not be good for the US economy, the China economy, but also for the economies of Asia and the world.""

Tensions have soared recently with Trump's administration rolling out billions of dollars in tariffs against China in a bid to tackle its trade deficit and rein in what Washington considers unacceptable Chinese trade practices.

Mnuchin said Washington's ultimate goal was a ""free, fair and reciprocal relationship"" with Beijing.

Attention has begun to turn toward hopes that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit next month in Argentina and bury the hatchet with some sort of agreement.

Mnuchin said no decision had been made yet and the US was not -- ""for the moment"" -- requiring any Chinese concessions before Trump agrees to a meeting.


""To the extent that we can make progress toward a meeting, I would encourage that and that's something we are having discussions about,"" he told reporters.


World markets also have been roiled by a plunge in some emerging market currencies -- including Turkey and Argentina -- as domestic financial crises and higher US interest rates lure returns-hungry investors to the dollar.



The IMF statement said it would push to improve the World Trade Organisation and boost confidence in the global trading system.


It added that it would continue to help countries deal with the social and economic costs of ""pandemics, cyber risks, climate change and natural disasters, energy scarcity, conflicts, migration, and refugee and other humanitarian crises"".","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/window-narrowing-for-global-economy-imf-warns/articleshow/66193706.cms"
"6","US wants to prohibit data localisation, top trade official says amid looming RBI directive","WASHINGTON: The US wants to prohibit data localisation to ensure that there is a free flow of information across borders, a senior Trump administration official has said, amidst reports that major American IT companies are up in arms against the latest Indian directive which kicks off next week.

Data localisation is an act of storing data on any device that is physically present within the borders of a particular country where the data was generated.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in a circular in April, said all system providers will have to ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in a system only in India. It gave time till October 15 to comply with the mandate.

""We want to have prohibitions on data localisation to ensure that there's free flow of information, free flow of data across borders, disciplines around countries requiring companies to give up their source code, permanent ban on taxation or duties on digital transmissions,"" Dennis Shea, Deputy US Trade Representative and US Ambassador to the WTO, told a Washington audience on Friday.

""And by the way, South Africa and India want to rethink the current moratorium on those duties,"" Shea said in response to a question at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a top American think-tank.

American financial companies are believed to have approached the administration against an RBI directive which, beginning October 15, requires them to store in India any payment-related data from transactions that take place inside the country.

India has rejected their request of mirroring.

""If implemented, this policy will put an unnecessary burden on American companies and hurt consumers, who will endure higher costs and increased cybersecurity risks,"" Republican Strategist Andy Surabian, who is also a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr, wrote in BreitBart News this week.

""And they are planning to do all of this in spite of the unprecedented level of economic support the US has provided India over the course of decades. The Trump administration should stand up to these reckless actions, just like they have done in other situations when Americans were getting bullied and pushed around,"" Surabian demanded.

During his CSIS appearance, Shea did not specifically pointed out India on the data localisation issue, but made his views pretty clear where the Trump administration stands on this issue.


Shea said the US is very engaged at the multilateral issue and has a very high-ambition approach to that.


The general view is that the negotiation part of this process may begin early next year, or perhaps a ministerial statement around Davos.



Other members of the WTO, he said, have lower ambitions so ""how this works out still remains to be seen,"" he added.


Mobile messaging platform WhatsApp has said it has built a system that stores payments-related data in India, in line with RBI's data localisation policy.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/us-wants-to-prohibit-data-localisation-top-trade-official-says-amid-looming-rbi-directive/articleshow/66192350.cms"
"7","Shoppers from tier II, III cities throng e-commerce sites for festive offers","New Delhi, Oct 14 () E-commerce companies like Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal and others have had a stellar festive season so far and have clocked billions of dollars worth of sale, as shoppers thronged to cash in on the attractive offers available on these platforms.
For most players, a big chunk of the new shoppers logged in from tier II and III cities and towns - a trend that is likely to continue till Diwali as these platforms continue to present more offers and schemes to woo customers.
According to Amit Agarwal, Senior Vice President and Country Head at Amazon India, three times more new customers have shopped on the company's platform for the first time during this sale, with a large portion of these customers coming from tier II and III cities.
Arch-rival Flipkart said it has seen record-breaking numbers across categories, including mobile phones, large appliances, and private labels from across the country. Flipkart CEO Kalyan Krishmamurthy had indicated that the company is likely to meet its targets by the fourth day of the sale itself. Latest numbers from the sale of these two giants were not available.
According to market watchers, presence of big brands on these sites, coupled with availability of discounts and easy finance schemes has played a key role in getting customers (especially from smaller towns) to shop online.
Paytm Mall COO Amit Sinha said its platform has received over 60 million visitors from more than 100 cities other than metro cities.
""...a lot of buyers are from tier II and III cities and are first time buyers ... (Paytm Mall) clocking a run-rate of over USD 5 billion in sales,"" he added.
For Snapdeal, new buyers account for about 38 per cent of all orders placed during the sale so far.
ShopClues, which crossed the 1.5 million-orders mark Sunday, said it has seen strong buying patterns from tier III and IV towns, especially from states like Karnataka, Kerala, Tamil Nadu, Assam, Gujarat, and Punjab.
Paytm Mall kicked off its festive sale from October 9, while the others began a day later. While the first leg of the sale ends on these platforms on Sunday and Monday, more offers are expected to be rolled out as Diwali approaches.
E-commerce companies in the country are estimated to have already clocked sales worth USD 1.5 billion (Rs 11,085 crore) in less than three days of festive sale, according to RedSeer Consulting.
This, according to the research firm, was achieved as consumers thronged the online platforms to buy smartphones (sale of 4.6 million units, translating into USD 800 million), large appliances (USD 170 million) and fashion (USD 120 million).
The industry is on track to reach the USD 3 billion-mark -- twice that of last year -- by the end of the five-day festive period, it had added.

"8","RCEP trade ministers urge members to put all efforts to conclude negotiations","New Delhi, Oct 14 () Trade ministers of 16-member RCEP bloc, including India and China, have urged all participating countries to continue to exert all efforts for early conclusion of the negotiations, the commerce ministry said Sunday.
The progress of the talks for the mega trade deal RCEP (Regional Comprehensive Economic Partnership) was discussed during the two day meet of ministers in Singapore, concluded Saturday.
""While appreciating some narrowing of gaps, the Ministers urged all RECP Participating Countries to continue to exert all efforts towards meeting the targets set in the package of year end deliverables,"" the ministry said in a statement.
Minister of State for Commerce and Industry C R Chaudhary attended the 6th RCEP Inter-sessional Ministerial Meeting (IMM) in Singapore on 12-13 October.
Chaudhary also held bilateral meeting with Trade Minister of Singapore. The island nation sought India's help in early conclusion of RCEP negotiations, it said.
Next round of meeting at chief negotiators level is scheduled to be held in Auckland later this month.
Earlier a joint statement issued after the meeting of trade ministers in August has stated that the countries adopted a package of year-end deliverables developed by the trade negotiating committee.
The ministers had expressed hope that completion of the package would signify the substantial conclusion of the RCEP negotiations this year. However, Commerce Minister Suresh Prabhu had earlier stated that the talks would continue for next year.
RCEP aims to cover goods, services, investments, economic and technical cooperation, competition and intellectual property rights.
The RCEP is a proposed free trade agreement being negotiated by 16 countries, including 10 Asean members (Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, Myanmar, Singapore, Thailand, the Philippines, Laos and Vietnam) and their six free trade agreement partners - India, China, Japan, South Korea, Australia and New Zealand, since November 2012.
The meeting assumes significance as there is a tremendous pressure on India to conclude the negotiations as early as possible despite the fact that several issues pertaining to goods and services have yet to be agreed upon by the member countries.
The mega pact aims to relax norms and significantly cut import duties to boost trade in goods, services, promote investments, technical cooperation, and intellectual property rights.

"9","Government invites bids for international Udan flights","MUMBAI: The central government has invited proposals from interested air operators for the international version of its 'Udan' (Ude Desk Ka Aam Nagrik) scheme as it seeks to enhance air connectivity from India to select overseas destinations.

This is despite the domestic format of the scheme failing to yield desired results with almost half of the routes approved in the first phase of the bidding for the scheme still to be launched.

National airports operator AAI, which has been mandated to implement the international version of the Udan scheme, has invited ""e-proposals (bids) from international bidders for selection of airlines under the International Air Connectivity Scheme, IACS Udan,"" according to a notice in a leading English daily.

The government, in its bid to make flying more affordable for masses, had in October 2016 announced the Udan scheme with airfares capped at Rs 2,500 for a one-hour journey through subsidised ticket rates and to provide air connectivity to smaller towns.

In the subsequent developments, five airlines were mandated to fly on 128 regional routes in the first phase of the bidding in March 2017, and 15 airlines on 325 regional routes, including those having chopper operations, in the second phase in January this year.

The Airports Authority of India (AAI) is also the implementing agency for the domestic format of the regional connectivity scheme.

The bids could be submitted to the AAI by November 22, according to the notice inviting e-proposals.

The AAI has invited the bids on behalf of the civil aviation ministry and the Assam government, as per the notice.

The central government had in August unveiled a draft scheme for extending the UDAN scheme to international circuits, with state governments identifying routes for the operations.

The draft International Air Connectivity (IAC) scheme envisages to increase the international ticketing to 20 crore by 2027.

As per the draft, the scheme is to be made operational only for states which demonstrate their commitment to implement and provide the requisite support for promoting operations under the scheme.


The BJP-ruled Assam had last year offered to provide Rs 100 crore as viability gap funding towards extension of the scheme for international air connectivity from the state capital Guwahati.

According to the draft scheme, state governments will identify the routes to be connected, and airline operators will assess demand on the identified routes and submit proposals for providing connectivity.


Operations under the scheme will be permitted through fixed-wing aircraft only with more than 70 seats.


The scheme has proposed to set up an International Air Connectivity Fund (IACF) -- dedicated for providing subsidy support under the scheme. It will be created through the contributions of state governments.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/government-invites-bids-for-international-udan-flights/articleshow/66204290.cms"

"11","Festive sale: SBI customers to get additional discount, cash back on YONO","New Delhi, Oct 14 () The SBI customers will get additional discounts and cash back on shopping through its digital platform YONO, as the lender wants to cash in on the festival season shopping spree.
YONO -- acronym for You Only Need One -- is the SBI's digital app for various services.
Apart from paperless banking, it offers investment in financial products and customers can also do shopping as the bank has on-boarded over 85 e-commerce players on YONO platform.
The SBI said it is the first ever bank to have come up with a digital shopping festival, in which it will offer discounts up to 10 per cent and cash back to customers using SBI credit and debit cards during October 16-21.
These discounts will be over and above what e-commerce players would offer to SBI customers during the sale.
""Our discounts of 10 per cent and cash back on purchases through SBI credit and debit card will be over and above the discounts up to 50 per cent offered by the top 14 e-commerce players on host of products ranging from fashion to furniture,"" SBI Managing Director PK Gupta told .
The SBI said customers will get exclusive and best in class offers from these top 14 e-commerce merchants in the YONO shopping festival (YSF).
It will also offer financing options to all SBI customers.
YSF deals include categories such as electronics, fashion, gifting, jewellery, furniture, travel, hospitality among others.
Amazon, Jabong, Myntra, Kalyan, Caratlane, PCJ, Pepperfry, OYO, Tata Cliq, Yatra, Easemytrip, Firstcry, IGP, Ferns & Petals are among top digital marketplaces, as per the SBI's exclusive partnership for YSF.
""We are doing a lot of things on YONO apart from banking. Lots of innovation is also happening, like we already have pre-approved loan on YONO which does not require a customer to visit a branch. So, we thought in the festival season it is a good idea to come up with a digital shopping offer to our customers with additional discount benefits,"" Gupta said.
The bank's one stop YONO platform was launched in November 2017 and is about to complete an year.
Gupta said the bank is witnessing good traction over YONO, particularly the younger generation customer which enthuses SBI to come up with such offerings.
There are already 3 million customers on board YONO and the bank is adding about 25,000 new customers on this platform per day, he added.
SBI said YSF is the first digital banking platform to offer customised products and services from around 85 e-commerce players by leveraging analytics.
YONO can be accessed through Android and iOS powered mobile phones, and on the web through a browser, an omni-channel for host of products apart from banking.

"12","Govt to give priority to state power producers for coal supply; pvt plants in lurch","New Delhi, Oct 14 () The government has asked Coal India Ltd and its subsidiaries to prioritise coal supply to state power producers like NTPC, leaving private electricity plants in a lurch, multiple sources said.
The coal ministry has directed CIL to prioritise the coal supply to select central and state government-owned power houses under the pretext of building coal stocks at these plants.
Following this, all subsidiaries of Coal India like South Eastern Coalfields Ltd (SECL) have been directed to supply coal to state power generators such as NTPC.
This has come at the cost of private power producers, who are running out of feedstock used to produce electricity.
Sources in private producers say rationally Coal India should give first priority to those plants having critical coal stocks. Next should come plants facing supplies below contractual obligations and then to most efficient plants, irrespective of ownership.
Preferential and priority distribution should not be limited to public sector, they said, adding that private power plants should not be discriminated against.
As per the sources, following the instruction from coal ministry, Coal India has its subsidiaries like SECL to supply 25 rakes per day of coal to NTPC's Korba, Mouda and Bhilai power plants and such other state power plants.
Mahanadi Coalfields Ltd (MCL) has also accorded priority supplies to central public sector plants and WCL has been verbally instructed to supply coal to only Mahagenco (formerly known as Maharashtra State Electricity Board) plants.
As a result, SECL in October increased the supplies to state and central generating companies from an average 10 rakes per day (40,000 tonnes) to 17 rakes per day (68,000 tonnes) whereas for private power plants it has reduced from an average 10 rakes per day to only 6 rakes per day (24000 Tons).
Private power generators feel such priority supply only to state and central PSU electricity generating companies is discriminatory.
This discrimination based on ownership of assets puts into question the sanctity of level playing field and ease of doing business besides being bad in the eyes of law and equity, they said.
The move comes just when the festive season has started when power demand goes up. Also, Madhya Pradesh, Rajasthan, Chhattisgarh, Mizoram and Telangana will go to polls this year.
Also, power tariff in spot market have hit a record high past few days. In last week of September, spot electricity price touched nine year high of Rs 14.25 per unit and swelled further to Rs 18.20 in the first week of October on Indian Energy Exchange.
This spark in power tariff was attributed to inadequate coal supplies from Coal India, the sources said.
While domestic coal production during April-September has risen to 256 million tonnes from 232 million tonnes in the year ago period, increased power demand has meant that coal imports have also risen to 119 million tonnes from 105 million tonnes in April-September 2017.
Coal imports in September were 21 million tonnes as compared to 16 million tonnes a year ago.
On October 8, SECL wrote its operational heads that following a September 24 meeting chaired by Coal Minister Piyush Goyal, it has been decided to ""prioritize the supply of coal"" to 11 public sector generators including NTPC.
""You are kindly requested to prioritize the supplies to the plants (listed) so as to bring them at comfortable stock position irrespective of the overall allotments placed by SECL. The matter is of utmost importance, hence immediate and necessary attention is highly solicited from you end,"" it said.

"13","India VC market saw investments of over USD 2 bn in Q3: KPMG","New Delhi, Oct 14 () India's venture capital market saw large sequential growth during the third quarter of 2018 with over USD 2 billion being invested, according to a report by KPMG.
""More than doubling the tally observed in Q2, the Indian venture ecosystem saw well over USD 2 billion invested last quarter, even as aggregate volume remains subdued,"" KPMG said in its Venture Pulse Q3 2018 report.
It added that hotel booking company Oyo Rooms alone accounted for USD 1 billion of this. The funding round -- led by SoftBank Investment Advisers (SBIA) through SoftBank Vision Fund -- had positioned it as India's second most valuable technology start-up after Paytm. Oyo has now leapt well into unicorn status with a USD 5 billion valuation.
Even though OYO's fund raise comprised a large share of that, it suggests that India's ongoing focus on consumer-oriented enterprises is still going strong, the report said.
India also saw several USD 100 million-plus mega deals this quarter, including USD 225 million by Udaan, USD 120 million by CureFit and USD 100 million by BookMyShow, it added.
Besides, online marketplaces continued to gain a lot of traction during the quarter under review, with second-hand car company Cars24 raising USD 50 million.
The top 10 financing rounds in the third quarter in the Asia Pacific region were Singapore's ridesharing platform Grab that raised USD 2 billion, followed by Bitmain from Beijing and Oyo Rooms, with each raising USD 1 billion each.
Xpeng from Guangzhou and Ximalaya from Shanghai raised USD 596.2 million each in the said quarter, the report noted.
KPMG in India Partner and National Leader Private Equity Nitish Poddar said Internet commerce is at a very exciting stage in India.
""Mobile penetration driven by strong demographics is what will drive the growth in the industry. Given the working age proportion of population in the country, consumer-led internet businesses will continue to see significant growth in the near future,"" he added.
These, he pointed out, include food, travel, auto and commerce.
""Fintech is also at a very exciting stage in the country -- the government's push to electronic money coupled with growth in internet commerce will see a significant growth in this space - payment gateways, online insurance and micro loans will stand to benefit,"" Poddar said.
The report said India's M&A market had soared to a ""record annual high"" during Q3 2018, reaching above the USD 100 billion mark for the first time in history.
""While some industry consolidation has helped spur the M&A activity, the tech market has played a large part in the rise,"" it added.
It cited the example of Walmart acquiring 77 per cent stake in India's e-commerce company Flipkart in a massive USD 16 billion deal and said market activity is expected to ""remain very high, heading into Q4'19 and well into next year"".

"14","Honest, consistent taxpayers to be feted by govt; policy proposal in works","NEW DELHI: The government is working on an ambitious policy proposal to ""facilitate"" honest and consistent taxpayers in availing a variety of public services and tax-related works on priority, officials said on Sunday.

They said that a committee under the Central Board of Direct Taxes, the policy-making body for the Income Tax Department (ITD), is working to chalk out the broad parameters for extending such ""courtesies"" and benefits to taxpayers who pay their taxes on time and in full.

The proposal will be vetted by the Finance Ministry and sent for final approval to the Prime Ministers Office (PMO) before it is cleared by the Union cabinet.

A cabinet note to enhance the output of the Central Processing Centre (CPC) of the department in Bengaluru has already been prepared and sent.

The capacity and automation of the CPC, the repository of tax payer's data and their IT Returns (ITRs), is proposed to be enhanced so that refunds can be issued real-time and ITRs of small taxpayers (with single source of income) can be processed within hours and not days, as prevalent at present, they said.

As part of the larger plan, they said, it is proposed that honest taxpayers are empowered to get ""priority service"" while using public services at airports, railways stations and at tolls on highways.

Prime Minister Narendra Modi, during a conference with senior tax officers last year, had urged the department to enhance taxpayer services and ensure that honest taxpayer are given due importance.

It is proposed that taxpayers who have been consistently paying their taxes or even just filing their returns can be hosted at civic receptions held by prominent government functionaries and are honoured publicly, they said.

A unique identity number could be given to such taxpayers or their permanent account number (PAN) could be flagged as special as part of this maiden taxpayer facilitation proposal, they added.

Few years back, the CBDT had started a process by which diligent taxpayers were sent thank you or appreciation notes over email under the name of the CBDT Chairman.

It is proposed to take this initiative forward and the CBDT committee is working on it, a senior official in the finance ministry said.

The committee of senior officers of the CBDT and the IT Department will soon submit its report to the board, they said.

It is also being thought to fully launch hassle-free electronic assessment of diligent taxpayers as part of the new proposal, they added.

The CBDT is already working to usher in a mega plan where a taxpayer can be assessed electronically in any part of the country, as part of its measures to reduce complaints of harassment and corruption in rendering these services.


At present, a taxpayer is assessed by an IT officer based in the city where the person earns their income.


""These new proposals could well be launched by the end of this year,"" a senior official said.


There are about 8 crore income taxpayers in the country at present and the CBDT has instructed the taxman to add 1.25 crore to this tally by the end of the current financial year in March next year.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/honest-consistent-taxpayers-to-be-feted-by-govt-policy-proposal-in-works/articleshow/66203352.cms"
"15","Total in talks to buy stake in Adani's LNG, city gas projects","New Delhi, Oct 14 () French energy giant Total SA is in talks to buy up to half of Adani Group's stake in LNG projects in Gujarat and Odisha, an under-construction LPG import facility and in its city gas projects, sources privy to the development said.
The French firm is keen on investing in fast growing gas market in India and finds Adani a suitable vehicle as it owns the crucial downstream infrastructure, they said.
Adani holds 25 per cent stake in just-completed 5 million tonnes a year liquefied natural gas (LNG) import terminal at Mundra. It is also building a similar capacity LNG import terminal at Dhamra in Odisha at a cost of Rs 5,100 crore.
Sources said Total is in talks to buy half of Adani's stake in the two terminals.
It is also looking at buying a 50 per cent stake in under-construction LPG import terminal that Adani is building at Mundra in Gujarat as well as a stake in Adani's flourishing city gas distribution projects, the sources said, adding that a preliminary pact may be signed this week during the visit of Total CEO Patrick Pouyanne to India.
India is looking at more than doubling the share of natural gas in its energy basket to 15 per cent in next few years and is giving major push to city gas distribution projects. It imports half of its gas needs, which are projected to rise exponentially as it shifts from polluting liquid fuels to environment friendly natural gas.
While an email sent to Total for comments remained unanswered, Adani Group spokesperson wasn't immediately available for comments.
While the Mundra LNG terminal has Gujarat State Petroleum Corp (GSPC) as the lead partner, Adani is building a new LPG import facility at the same port with a total capacity to 3.56 million tonnes per annum. The LPG terminal is to be completed by next month.
Adani Gas, a subsidiary of Adani Enterprises Ltd, is developing city gas distribution (CGD) networks to supply the piped natural gas (PNG) to the industrial, commercial, domestic (residential) units and compressed natural gas (CNG) to the transport sector.
It already has set up city gas distribution networks in Ahmedabad and Vadodara in Gujarat, Faridabad in Haryana and Khurja in Uttar Pradesh.
It has, in the recently concluded CGD bid round, won rights to 13 cities on its own and another 9 in joint venture with state-owned Indian Oil Corp (IOC). These are in addition to the 50:50 Adani-IOC joint venture winning rights to develop CGD network in Allahabad, Chandigarh, Ernakulam, Panipat, Daman, Dharwad, and Udhamsingh Nagar in previous bid rounds.
Sources said Total is looking at buying half of Adani's stake all the CGD networks.
The development comes weeks after Total announced its exit from Royal Dutch Shell-operated Hazira LNG terminal in Gujarat.
It sold its 26 per cent stake in the project to Shell.
Total had in March 2004 picked up 26 per cent stake in the 2.5 million tonnes a year Hazira liquefied natural gas import terminal in Gujarat. The terminal capacity was later doubled to 5 million tonne. Hazira LNG terminal was commissioned in 2005 and expanded to 5 million tonnes in 2013. Shell held the remaining 74 per cent stake in the company.
Total has signed an agreement to sell 0.5 million tonne LNG per year to Shell over five years, on a delivery basis to supply the Indian and neighbouring markets. The deliveries will be sourced from Total's global LNG portfolio and are expected to begin in 2019.

"16","DoT limits subscriber enrolment during network test to 5%; trial phase to 180 days","New Delhi, Oct 14 () The telecom department has restricted enrolment of test subscribers on network of a new mobile operator to 5 per cent of its network capacity during trial phase and testing period to maximum six months.
""The number of test subscribers that can be enrolled by a licensee in licensed service area (LSA or telecom circle) shall be limited to 5 per cent of its installed network capacity for that LSA,"" the department said in its order.
The order has come in to effect from October 9.
The telecom operator will need to submit details of network capacity to the Department of Telecom (DoT) and Telecom Regulatory Authority of India at least 15 days before commencing enrolment of test subscribers.
The guidelines come following issue of continuous enrolment of test subscribers when Reliance Jio started its network test. Rivals of Jio approached the DoT and the telecom regulator to act against the practice, alleging that Jio is on-boarding customers by masquerading them as test subscribers.
Mukesh Ambani led Jio started testing of 4G network with its employees first in late 2015 and gradually opened it for all customers without announcing final date for commercial launch of its 4G service. The company had enrolled around 15 lakh customers before commercially starting its service on September 5.
The DoT order restricts network test to 90 days and on case-to-case basis the test phase can extended to 180 days.
""There shall be limit of 90 days on the test phase involving test subscribers. However, if the TSP fails to conclude network testing due to valid reasons, it may make representations to DoT seeking additional time for network testing giving detailed justification...the total time period for network testing provided to the TSP shall not exceed 180 days,"" the order said.
During the test phase, the subscriber on the network will not be able to avail mobile number portability service.
The order bars telecom operator testing network from charging any fee from subscribers and the company will also need to share likely date of commercial launch of service before starting the process, according to the order.

"17","Free/complementary IPL tickets to attract GST: AAR","New Delhi, Oct 14 () Free or complementary tickets given by franchise owners for IPL matches will attract Goods and Services Tax (GST), the Authority for Advance Ruling (AAR) said.
In response to an application filed by K P H Dream Cricket Pvt Ltd, which owns and operates IPL cricket team Kings XI Punjab, the Punjab bench of the AAR has ruled that providing complementary tickets free of charge would be considered supply of service and therefore leviable to tax.
The GST rate on sale of IPL tickets is 18 per cent.
The AAR also ruled that K P H Dream Cricket would be eligible to claim input tax credit (ITC) on taxes paid for such complementary tickets only to the extent of input and input service for such tickets.
The AAR said when the applicant issues a 'complimentary ticket' to any person, the applicant is ""certainly displaying an act of forbearance by tolerating persons who are receiving the services provided by the applicant without paying any money, which other persons not receiving such complimentary tickets would have to pay for"".
Stating that the complementary tickets given by K P H Dream Cricket to various persons would certainly be covered by the term 'token' and 'voucher', the AAR said as per GST laws the monetary value of ""forbearance would naturally be pegged to the amount of money charged from other persons not receiving the 'complementary tickets' for availing the same services.""
""The applicant has clearly missed the import of clause (b) in the definition of 'Consideration' given in section 2(31) of the CGST Act, 2017 which certainly covers the activity of the applicant of giving 'complementary tickets' to certain persons in the furtherance of his business and would thus be covered under scope of supply defined in Section 7(1)(a) of the CGST Act, 2017,"" the AAR said.
Commenting on the order, EY Tax Partner Abhishek Jain said: ""A levy of GST on free supply of services to unrelated parties is not envisaged under the GST law. The ruling is against the no GST position adopted by the industry on such transactions"".

"18","Edu, marketing, agri possible re-entry points for workforce post automation: Report","New Delhi, Oct 14 () Even as the debate on whether new-age technologies like automation will trigger job losses or create new roles goes on, a study by AIMA-PwC shows that industries like education, marketing and even agriculture are perceived as likely re-entry points for workforce if one's current job gets automated.
The study, titled 'How AI is reshaping jobs in India', said employees across sectors have started recognising the need for upgrading skills in emerging areas like artificial intelligence, robotics, Big Data and machine learning over the next five years to support the current roles and responsibilities in their respective industries.
In order to enhance their preparedness for the automation era, 60 per cent of the respondents said they were willing to upgrade their skills via training programmes/initiatives organised by employers.
Interestingly, the results also indicate that people believe that education and teaching (30 per cent), followed by marketing, management and business services (28 per cent) offer ""the most realistic opportunities for them to re-enter the workforce if their current job undergoes automation"".
About 16 per cent said they perceived manufacturing as a likely re-entry point, while 14 per cent pointed to agriculture, forestry and fishing.
""This indicates that in a post-automation workforce, roles that require accumulated knowledge, expertise and people-centric qualities such as persuasiveness and empathy might stand out as differentiating factors to ensure employability,"" the report said.
The report pointed out that as AI continues to evolve, the threat of job loss also arises but these displacements will be accompanied by the creation of new job profiles that require great human involvement and critical thinking.
Therefore, AI provides an opportunity to reshape the workforce, and collaborative efforts between the government, academia and private sector should be encouraged.
The report acknowledged that there is a huge unmet demand for skilled professionals in the field of AI and machine learning and that catching up in this race would require a two-pronged approach -- upskilling existing employees as well as attracting AI experts.
While it is primarily the responsibility of individuals to keep themselves updated and relevant to the job by investing time in acquiring new skills and capabilities, educational bodies also need to migrate the traditional curriculum to incorporate course work that is in sync with new age technology and emerging industry demands.
Also, with the increasing percolation of AI within companies and adoption of new technologies, on-the-job training for employees would become more vital to transition people into new rolls, the report said.

"19","PM to brainstorm oil scenario with global CEOs","New Delhi, Oct 14 () Prime Minister Narendra Modi will Monday brainstorm with chief executives of top global and Indian oil and gas companies on emerging energy scenario, with ripples from US sanctions on Iran and volatile oil prices threatening growth.
The third annual meeting would also deliberate on ways to revive investment in oil and gas exploration and production, official sources said.
Modi's first meeting was on January 5, 2016 where suggestions for reforming natural gas prices were made. More than a year later, the government allowed higher natural gas price for yet-to-be-produced fields in difficult areas like deep sea.
In the last edition in October 2017, suggestions were made for giving out equity to foreign and private companies in producing oil and gas fields of state-owned ONGC and OIL. But the plan could not go through in view of strong opposition from Oil and Natural Gas Corp (ONGC).
Sources said Saudi Oil Minister Khalid A Al Falih, BP CEO Bob Dudley, Total head Patrick Fouyane, Reliance Industries Chairman Mukesh Ambani and Vedanta chief Anil Agarwal are expected to attend the meeting Monday.
The meeting, coordinated by the NITI Aayog, is likely to focus on challenges posed by volatile oil prices and the US sanctions on Iran.
The meeting would look at measures to attract investments and steps for making it easier to do business in India.
Sources said reforms initiated in the last four years in the oil and gas sector, including open acreage policy, pricing reforms and liberalised licensing policy, will be showcased and suggestions would be sought on what more can be done to hasten growth.
The government is looking at private investment to raise domestic oil and gas production, which has stagnated for the last few years while fuel demand has been rising by 5-6 per cent annually. India is dependent on imports to meet 83 per cent of its demand and more than half of its natural gas requirements.
The Prime Minister in 2015 had set a target of reducing India's oil dependence by 10 per cent to 67 per cent (based on import dependence of 77 per cent in 2014-15) by 2022. Import dependence has only increased since then and the government is now looking for ways to raise domestic output.
Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) Secretary General Mohammed Barkindo and India's Oil Minister Dharmendra Pradhan would also attend the meeting, they said.
Also likely to attend the meeting are ONGC Chairman and Managing Director Shashi Shanker, Indian Oil Corporation (IOC) Chairman Sanjiv Singh, GAIL India head B C Tripathi, Hindustan Petroleum Corp Ltd (HPCL) Chairman Mukesh Kumar Suran, Oil India Chairman Utpal Bora and Bharat Petroleum Corp Ltd (BPCL) Chairman D Rajkumar.

A massive 3.4 lakh road crashes of the total 4.7 lakh accidents last year occurred on sunny clear days, as per the report on accidents in 2017 by Ministry of Road Transport and Highways.
Accidents under adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, fog and hail/sleet accounted for only 16 per cent of total road accidents last year.
""Adverse weather conditions such as heavy rain, thick fog and hail storms make driving riskier as visibility reduces and road surface gets slippery. The data of road accidents for 2017, however, shows that almost 3/4th of the accidents took place under sunny/clear weather,"" the report said.
Of the 4.70 lakh road accidents last year, 1.47 lakh people lost their lives, it said.

"24","US Senators write to PM Modi, urge to soften stance on India's data localisation policy","WASHINGTON: Two top American Senators have asked Prime Minister Narendra Modi to adopt a soft stance on data localisation, warning that India's policy on the issue will adversely affect American businesses in the country.


Data localisation is an act of storing data on any device that is physically present within the borders of a particular country where the data was generated.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in a circular in April, said all system providers will have to ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in a system only in India. It gave time till October 15 to comply with the mandate.

In a letter to Prime Minister Modi dated Friday, US Sentors John Cornyn and Mark Warner -- who also hold top leadership positions in their own parties -- have opposed the data localisation requirement of the Indian government.

""Data localisation requirements, such as those contained in the draft data protection bill and draft national e-commerce policy framework, will have negative impacts on the ability of companies to do business in India, may undermine your own economic goals, and will likely not improve the security of Indian citizens' data,"" they said.

Cornyn from the Republican Party and Warner from the Democratic Party are co-chairs of the powerful Senate India Caucuses.

When companies adopt high-quality privacy safeguards, the location of data has no bearing on whether the data is secure, they argued.

""In addition to effectively reducing data security, forced data localisation requirements create inefficiencies for both businesses and consumers, raising the cost of procuring and delivering data services including ones that local Indian businesses utilize on a daily basis,” the Senators said.

""Ultimately, they also increase the cost, and/or reduce the availability of, data-dependent services,"" said the letter, a copy of which has been obtained by PTI.

The two Senators said that forced data localisation will also be counterproductive when it comes to India modernising its framework regarding law enforcement requests for data.

""Both the protection and security of data-as well as access to data for lawful purposes-can be enabled without a requirement that data be stored in a specific physical location. We encourage increased dialogue on these issues between law enforcement agencies in the US and India,"" the powerful Senators wrote.

The letter comes amidst reports that major American IT companies are up in arms against the latest Indian directive.

American financial companies are believed to have approached the administration against the RBI directive which, beginning October 15, requires them to store in India any payment-related data from transactions that take place inside the country.

India has rejected their request of mirroring.

On Friday, Deputy US Trade Representative and US Ambassador to the WTO Dennis Shea said that the US wants to prohibit data localisation to ensure that there is a free flow of information across borders.

""We want to have prohibitions on data localisation to ensure that there's free flow of information, free flow of data across borders, disciplines around countries requiring companies to give up their source code, permanent ban on taxation or duties on digital transmissions,"" Shea said.


Shea did not specifically pointed out India on the data localisation issue, but made his views pretty clear where the Trump administration stands on this issue.

Republican Strategist Andy Surabian, who is also a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr, wrote in BreitBart News last week that if implemented, this policy will put an unnecessary burden on American companies and hurt consumers, who will endure higher costs and increased cybersecurity risks.


Meanwhile, mobile messaging platform WhatsApp has said it has built a system that stores payments-related data in India, in line with RBI's data localisation policy.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/us-senators-write-to-pm-modi-urge-to-soften-stance-on-indias-data-localisation-policy/articleshow/66202387.cms"
"25","Saudi stocks plunge 7% on Khashoggi fallout; biggest drop since 2014","DUBAI: Saudi Arabia's stock market plunged on Sunday as investors worried about deteriorating relations with the international community after the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi.

After nearly two hours of trade the index was down 7.0 percent, its biggest drop since December 2014, when oil prices were crashing. Shares in the region's biggest petrochemical producer, Saudi Basic Industries, tumbled 7.9 percent.

""It’s the political environment. The market is reacting negatively to sentiment around the Khashoggi case and the political noise around it,"" said Salah Shamma, head of investment for the region at Franklin Templeton Emerging Markets Equity, a big global fund manager.

Shamma noted the fundamental situation of the Saudi economy had not so far been affected.

But regional traders said speculation the Khashoggi case might deter some inflows of foreign investment - and that a backlash in the US Congress could lead to U.S. sanctions against some Saudi individuals - had triggered panic selling of stocks by some local investors.

""It seems that international accounts are punishing the Saudi exchange,"" a regional broker added.


Khashoggi, a prominent critic of Riyadh and a US resident, disappeared on Oct. 2 after visiting the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. Turkey believes he was deliberately killed inside the building and his body removed. Riyadh has dismissed the claims.


U.S. President Donald Trump said on Saturday there would be ""severe punishment"" for Saudi Arabia if it turned out that Khashoggi was killed in the consulate.

Media companies and some technology executives have pulled out of a major Saudi investment conference scheduled for next week in Riyadh because of growing outrage over the disappearance.


Other stock markets in the Gulf opened higher on Sunday but began falling as Riyadh plunged, with the Dubai index sinking 1.4%.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/saudi-stocks-plunge-7-on-khashoggi-fallout-biggest-drop-since-2014/articleshow/66203601.cms"
"26","Elon Musk-led Tesla actually files trademark application for 'Teslaquila'","NEW DELHI: What started as an April Fools’ Day joke that left a poor taste in Tesla Inc investors’ mouths may soon become a reality.

The electric-car maker submitted a trademark application on October 8 for Teslaquila, describing the planned product as a distilled agave liquor. It was filed as “based on intent to use,” which means Tesla doesn’t have the product ready just yet. The company needs to actually be making a product to obtain the trademark.

Tesla chief executive officer Elon Musk tweeted on Friday that the brand would be coming soon. Musk also posted a mock-up of roughly what the tequila bottle will look like.

"27","Why Pakistan’s 13th bailout will also be its toughest","NEW DELHI: With Pakistan formally requesting IMF or International Monetary Fund aid (it plans to raise anywhere between $6 billion to more than $12 billion), it will be the country’s 13th loan programme since 1988.

Islamabad’s cycle of financial crashes and bailouts has also been about taking the lender's money but dragging its heels on economic reforms that should follow. It has successfully completed just one IMF programme (meaning it received all the disbursements as planned) in 2016 and even then a number of requirements were relaxed.


But this time the loan terms are likely to be tougher, including a closer scrutiny on the debt it owes to China. Pakistan knows this and has shown some signs of following the path. It devalued its rupee — the most in two decades after long-standing IMF observations that the currency was overvalued. It has said that it will publish the terms of the Chinese loans.


Currency devaluations that may stoke inflation are among the key challenges ahead for populist new Prime Minister Imran Khan.



This time the army is worried too, especially after US President Donald Trump cut military aid to Pakistan earlier this year.

"28","US has taken toughest-ever action on China's unfair trade practices: Donald Trump","WASHINGTON: US President Donald Trump has said that his administration has taken the ""toughest-ever action"" to crack down on China's unfair trade practices.

Trump has been steadily hiking tariffs on Chinese exports to the US since June, asking Beijing to bring down the billions of dollars of trade deficit.

He has taken an unprecedented tough measure against the alleged unfair trade practices of China. The US has a nearly $500 billion trade deficit with China per annum, which Trump says is unsustainable for the US.

""We have taken the toughest-ever action to crack down on China's unfair trade actions and trade abuses,"" Trump told his cheering supporters at an election rally in Ohio on Friday.

Among the steps being taken by the US include imposing additional 25 per cent tariff on import of Chinese products worth $250 billion, announcing new curbs of nuclear technology trade with China and taking steps to stop China from allegedly stealing intellectual property from the US.

Trump patted on his back with regard to his China policy as he listed out the achievements of his administration and the steps that has strengthened the American economy and creating jobs.

""Thanks to our tariff and especially on steel that's been dumped all over this country, the Ohio steel industry and the US steel industry is roaring back to life and soon will be hitting its most successful years ever,"" he said.

Last week, he announced the replacement of North America Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) ""with the incredible, brand-new"" US-Mexico-Canada trade agreement, the USMCA, Trump said.

""It's opening up Canada, opening up Mexico for our farmers, everybody,"" he said.

Trump said that at his direction, the Pentagon is now working to create the sixth branch of the American armed forces called the Space Force.

""That's very important. Hate to say it, but very soon, that's where it's going to be at. It's going to be space, everything, defence, offense, everything,"" he said.


Referring to his withdrawal from the Iranian nuclear deal, Trump said that this was one-sided.


""I withdrew the United States from the horrible one-sided Iran nuclear deal and look what happened to Iran,"" he said.



""When I took office, Iran was all over the place. They were taking over Syria. They were taking over Yemen. They were taking over everything. I actually said, this is going to be a problem and we've got to do something.


""And about four months ago, we withdrew from that horrible, ridiculous deal. And you take a look what's happening to Iran. There's riots all over the streets, all over the cities. It's a whole different ballgame. It's a whole different country. And it's looking real good,"" Trump said.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/us-has-taken-toughest-ever-action-on-chinas-unfair-trade-practices-donald-trump/articleshow/66193781.cms"
"29","Window 'narrowing' for global economy, IMF warns","INDONESIA: The window of opportunity for safeguarding global growth is ""narrowing"" as trade disputes deepen and emerging markets face fiscal crisis, the IMF said on Saturday, warning countries against worsening things by weaponising currency and interest-rate policies.

US Treasury secretary Steven Mnuchin had downplayed the global concerns expressed at an International Monetary Fund meeting held this week in Bali under the shadow of US-China tensions, saying the world would benefit if Beijing is forced to changes its trade policies.

But the IMF said in a communique that while global growth currently remained ""steady"", the risks are ""increasingly skewed to the downside amid heightened trade tensions and ongoing geopolitical concerns"".

The fund kicked off its annual meeting with the World Bank on the Indonesian resort island earlier in the week in a gloomy mood, preoccupied by the trade tussle between the world's two biggest economies, and tightening financial conditions faced by emerging markets.

On Tuesday, it cut its outlook for global GDP growth by 0.2 percentage points to 3.7 per cent for 2018 and 2019, citing the trade war.

""The window of opportunity (is) narrowing,"" the 189-country organisation said, adding that members would ""refrain from competitive (currency) devaluations and will not target our exchange rates for competitive purposes"" -- a line apparently aimed at the US and China.

Mnuchin this week said he had told the head of China's central bank about his concerns over the weakness of its currency.

US President Donald Trump has accused Beijing of depreciating its currency to absorb the impact of US trade tariffs.

But Mnuchin, speaking on the Bali meeting's sidelines, declined to comment on whether Washington would declare Beijing a ""currency manipulator"" in a Treasury report due out next week.

That would be a first for China, triggering a process that could lead to punitive steps.

Mnuchin also pushed back against the growing global angst over the US-China trade fight, saying that pressuring Beijing into adopting more open trade policies would be good for all.

""Our objective with China is very clear: it's to have a more balanced trading relationship,"" he said.

""I think that if we are successful, this is very good for US companies, US workers, Europeans, Japan, all of our other allies, and good for China.""

The argument gained little traction in Bali on Saturday.

""Trade conflict would be bad for all economies, not just the US and China,"" Japanese central bank governor Haruhiko Kuroda said.

""This type of thing will not be good for the US economy, the China economy, but also for the economies of Asia and the world.""

Tensions have soared recently with Trump's administration rolling out billions of dollars in tariffs against China in a bid to tackle its trade deficit and rein in what Washington considers unacceptable Chinese trade practices.

Mnuchin said Washington's ultimate goal was a ""free, fair and reciprocal relationship"" with Beijing.

Attention has begun to turn toward hopes that Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping could meet on the sidelines of the G-20 summit next month in Argentina and bury the hatchet with some sort of agreement.

Mnuchin said no decision had been made yet and the US was not -- ""for the moment"" -- requiring any Chinese concessions before Trump agrees to a meeting.


""To the extent that we can make progress toward a meeting, I would encourage that and that's something we are having discussions about,"" he told reporters.


World markets also have been roiled by a plunge in some emerging market currencies -- including Turkey and Argentina -- as domestic financial crises and higher US interest rates lure returns-hungry investors to the dollar.



The IMF statement said it would push to improve the World Trade Organisation and boost confidence in the global trading system.


It added that it would continue to help countries deal with the social and economic costs of ""pandemics, cyber risks, climate change and natural disasters, energy scarcity, conflicts, migration, and refugee and other humanitarian crises"".","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/window-narrowing-for-global-economy-imf-warns/articleshow/66193706.cms"
"30","WTO not equipped to deal with China and its industrial policies: US","WASHINGTON: China's economic system is not compatible with the norms of the WTO, the Trump administration has said, asserting that the international trade body is not equipped to deal with Beijing and its industrial policies.

The Trump administration is also seeking to redefine the term 'developing nations' as countries like China, despite being the world's second largest economy, are being considered as developing, that gives them certain benefits under the World Trade Organization (WTO).

""Too many countries at the WTO self-designate as developing countries. And as a developing country at the WTO, you enjoy additional flexibilities and exemptions from the rules,"" Dennis Shea, deputy US trade representative and US ambassador to the WTO, told a Washington audience on Friday.

""If you look at who some of these countries are, though, it's pretty amazing that they're claiming to be developing countries at the WTO,"" he said.

For example, 10 of the G-20 members claim developing country status at the WTO.

China, which is the second largest economy in the world, claims developing country status at the WTO, Shea said.

Five of the six countries with the largest GDP per capita claim developing country status at the WTO, he said during his appearance before the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a top American think-tank.

US trade representative Bob Lighthizer, Shea said, raised that issue at the ministerial conference in Buenos Aries in December and has a real conversation going on at the WTO about whether there should be more differentiation among developing countries.

In July, he said, the US offered a paper on China's economic model and the point of the paper was the economic model is essentially inconstant with the WTO norms.

""And I had a big back-and-forth with my Chinese counterpart. In fact, people said it was the most exciting time they've ever seen at a General Council meeting at the WTO. And my reaction was, 'Well, if this is the most exciting time this place must be pretty boring',"" Shea said.

Indicating tightening of the US approach against China, Shea said that the middle-of-the-road approach on some of the issues, particularly around China, is no longer viable.

""We really need to recognise that the economic system of China is not compatible with the WTO norms,"" he said, asserting that other countries need to speak up on this.

The WTO, as currently constituted, is not equipped to handle the China issue.

""One of my jobs is to help educate the membership about the ramifications of China's non-market economy, not just for the US, but for the WTO membership at large,"" Shea said.

That is the reason why, he observed, the US submitted that paper on the Chinese economic model at the last general council meeting in July.

The US, Japan and the EU are now engaged in the trilateral process, in which they are looking at ways to share information.

""They're looking at a number of areas. One on industrial subsidies and state-owned enterprises; another on the issue of forced technology transfer; and, the third issue on, you know, defining: what are the elements of a market economy? Can we have a common understanding of what a market economy is?"" the top US trade official said.

""Part of this effort involves development of new rules. So the US and the EU and the Japan are engaged in discussions, at a technical staff level, about the development of new rules around industrial subsidies and SOEs -- that's the furthest along -- and potentially new rules around forced technology transfer,"" Shea said.


Responding to a question, Shea said that in China, there is no independent judiciary, which can resolve disputes among stakeholders in China in impartial manner.


""Should China be kicked out of the WTO if the US loses?"" he was asked. ""You know, yes,"" he answered.



""We are committed to the trilateral process. We're working, hopefully we'll develop a common understanding what new rules would look like with the EU and Japan, and then branch out from there.


""We are probably a little more skeptical about the viability of rules to actually significantly modify Chinese behaviour. But that does not mean we should not pursue this approach, which we are pursuing,"" he added.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/wto-not-equipped-to-deal-with-china-and-its-industrial-policies-us/articleshow/66192057.cms"

China currently operates high speed bullet trains at the maximum speed of 350 kmph. It has been developing new bullet trains and researching on the next generation magnetic-levitation trains.

The scale model was exhibited at the 2018 National Mass Innovation and Entrepreneurship Week in the Chinese city of Chengdu in southwest Sichuan province on Wednesday.

The train which the State-owned China Aerospace Science and Industry Corporation Limited (CASIC) began developing in 2015 and dubbed as ""T-Flight"", will use an integrated, light and heat-proof cabin that is 29.2 meters long and three meters wide, the Global Times quoted a report of Chengdu Business daily as saying.

The train will float 100 millimeters above the ground due to a close-to-vacuum railway environment and magnetic levitation technology, Wang Yan, an official at CASIC's Magnetic Levitation and Electromagnetic Propulsion Department, was quoted saying.

""The train will slowly accelerate to 1,000 kms an hour,"" said Wang, noting that the passengers will be safe and feel comfortable.

Sun Zhang, a railway expert and professor at Shanghai Tongji University, said that the exhibit of the flight train shows that China is keeping up with its US counterpart in the respective field.


Some of the US based companies like Hyperloop Transportation Technologies and Hyperloop One are testing high speed technologies with a designed speed faster than 1,000 kilometers an hour.


Many technologies like electromagnetic propulsion used in the flight train are similar to aerospace technologies, Sun said.



Sun said that despite the fast-paced schedule, the technology remains experimental and will not have a direct impact on people's lives anytime soon.

"36","Negligible impact seen on internet service due to upgradation of keys at servers: ICANN","NEW DELHI: Global Internet body ICANN said on Friday that it has noted only a handful cases where net services might have affected adversely due to the upgradation of 'keys' at vital web servers that took place on October 11.

""It is now about 20 hours since the rollover and based on all information we have, everything is going smoothly. There have been only a small handful of reports of issues suspected to be caused by the rollover. In all cases it appears the impact was minor and the issues were quickly resolved,"" an ICANN spokesperson told PTI.

ICANN announced in July 2016 to upgrade cryptographic keys that are required to access security system of website names, called Domain Name System Security Extensions (DNSSEC).

When an internet user types a website on his browser, the broadband or Internet modem transmits that name to a system called resolver - which converts the website name in to numeric form containing code and server address of the website.

ICANN has asked all internet service providers to upgrade their software that resolves the website name in to digital code and directs the traffic to right server.

DNSSEC is an additional layer which validates the website name has been converted correctly.

The keys required to access the DNSSEC central server system called root zone were implemented in 2010 and hence were required to be upgraded for protection.

The transition was planned for October 11 , 2017 but was deferred by a year due to unclear data received just before the rollover.

Before running the system upgrade, ICANN had estimated that more than 99 per cent of users whose system are validating DNSSSEC will be unaffected by the rollover while the body that handles website name allocation in Asia, Regional Internet Registry for the Asia Pacific region (APNIC) had estimated that only 0.05 per cent of Internet users would be negatively affected by the transition.


The ICANN spokesperson said no one can know definitively which operators have enabled DNSSEC validation on their resolvers, and because no one but the operator can tell if a resolver with DNSSEC validation enabled was ready for the rollover.


""...no one could know exactly which users might be affected by the KSK rollover and where they would be,"" the spokesperson said.



However, Internet service providers whose system did not perform DNSSEC validation function will not be impacted by the transition at all.


According to ICANN estimates are that about two thirds of users are behind resolvers that do not yet perform DNSSEC validation.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/global-internet-shutdown-likely-over-next-48-hours/articleshow/66179871.cms"
"37","Who runs the economic world? It might soon be women","INDONESIA: Who runs the world? It might soon be women as a crop of female economists join IMF chief Christine Lagarde in top positions at major financial bodies.

As the International Monetary Fund and World Bank meet this week in Bali, Lagarde no longer cuts quite the same lone figure she once did, now flanked by growing numbers of female finance ministers and economists.

The IMF has just named Gita Gopinath to replace its outgoing chief economist Maurice Obstfeld, making her the first woman to hold the post.

India-born Gita Gopinath appointed IMF chief economist


Gopinath, 46, a well-respected economics professor at Harvard University and co-editor of the prestigious American Economic Review, is likely to bring a fresh perspective to the institution, and potentially challenge longstanding positions.

While the IMF has traditionally promoted flexible exchange rates to protect against economic shocks, Gopinath's work has long advocated the opposite.

Lagarde acknowledged the gap between the Fund's traditional stance and Gopinath's work, saying the Indian-American's ""stellar"" reputation was built around ""the role of the US dollar in international transactions, and the rigidity that it implies"".

But she said Gopinath would continue that work at the Washington-based IMF.

""I am sure that we will be exploring further and deeper those particular (avenues),"" Lagarde added.

""There are not many candidates that I can see at the moment that are prepared to be the currency operators, with the responsibility that comes with it.""

Gopinath is only the latest woman to be appointed to a top economic role, with the World Bank in April naming Yale professor Pinelopi Koujianou Goldberg its chief economist.

The Greek, who has a PhD from Stanford, became only the second woman to occupy that position.

And in June, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) appointed Laurence Boone, a former advisor to French president Francois Hollande, to its chief economist post.

In Bali, the trend is on display, with female finance ministers, central bankers and economists among the speakers and in the audience at sessions.

Among them is host country Indonesia's well-regarded Finance Minister Sri Mulyani Indrawati, who earlier this week emphasised the importance of visible female role models in top economic jobs.

""Finance minister has always been seen as man's job,"" she told a seminar about empowering women in the workplace on the sidelines of the meeting on the Indonesian holiday island.

""Battling this perception that this is a male job and for a woman you have to be an extra, extraordinary to do this male job... That creates a real huge burden.""

The 56-year-old, in her second term as finance minister after working at the World Bank, regularly finds herself delivering speeches on Indonesia's economy to majority-male audiences.

At the same panel, Lagarde also urged greater visibility for women across the professional world, and referred to the way US Open champion Naomi Osaka helped raise the profile of women's tennis in Japan with her recent win over Serena Williams.

""Suddenly (women's) tennis became a really powerful sport,"" the IMF chief said.

""We need to encourage and celebrate women who win.""


Carolyn Wilkins, senior deputy governor of the Bank of Canada, said the need for visible role models extended to universities.


""Woman are more likely to choose a major if they know another woman who did the same course,"" she told the seminar.



But Wilkins remains relatively alone in the top ranks of the world's central banks, still largely a male bastion.


Women have held top positions in the central banks of South Africa and Israel, among others, and Janet Yellen headed the US Federal Reserve under president Barack Obama, making her one of the most influential figures in the world of monetary policy.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/who-runs-the-economic-world-it-might-soon-be-women/articleshow/66178680.cms"
"38","China-US surplus hits record, adding fuel to trade war","BEIJING: China's trade surplus with the United States ballooned to a record $34.1 billion in September, despite a raft of US tariffs, official data showed Friday, adding fuel to the fire of a worsening trade war.

Relations between the world's two largest economies have soured sharply this year, with US President Donald Trump vowing on Thursday to inflict economic pain on China if it does not blink.

China's exports to the US rose to $46.7 billion while imports slumped to $12.6 billion, according to China's customs administration.

The world's top two economies imposed new tariffs on a massive amount of each other's goods mid-September, with the US targeting $200 billion in Chinese imports and Beijing firing back at $60 billion worth of US goods.

""China-US trade friction has caused trouble and pounded our foreign trade development,"" customs spokesman Li Kuiwen told reporters Friday.

China's overall trade -- what it buys and sells with all countries including the US -- logged a $31.7 billion surplus, as exports rose faster than imports.

Exports jumped 14.5 per cent for September on-year, beating forecasts from analysts polled by Bloomberg News, while imports rose 14.3 per cent on-year.

While the data showed China's trade remained strong for the month, analysts forecast the trade war will start to hurt in coming months.

""The big picture is the Chinese exports have so far held up well in the face of escalating trade tensions and cooling global growth, most likely thanks to the competitiveness boost provided by a weaker renminbi (yuan),"" said Julian Evans-Pritchard, China economist at Capital Economics.

""With global growth likely to cool further in the coming quarters and US tariffs set to become more punishing, the recent resilience of exports is unlikely to be sustained,"" he said.

Trump accused China of thinking Americans are ""stupid"" and boasted that his tariffs had already ""had a big impact"" on China's stumbling economy in a Thursday interview on Fox News.

""I have a lot more to do if I want to do it. I don't want to do it but they have to come to the table,"" he warned.

The yuan has fallen for weeks against the US dollar, dropping nine per cent in the past six months, which mitigates the rise in the price of Chinese goods caused by punitive US tariffs.

US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, in comments published in the Financial Times this week warned China against engaging in competitive currency devaluations.

China has steadfastly denied that it has manipulated the yuan to cope with the tariffs.


The US dollar has strengthened against a range of currencies this year as American interest rates have risen.


China's stock market has plunged this year but the trade war has also started to erode Trump's oft-touted US stock gains, with the Dow Jones Industrial Average down more than five per cent for the week.

The International Monetary Fund this week cited the trade war as it lowered its 2019 growth forecast for China, which is set to see its slowest expansion since 1990.

"39","Trump says Federal Reserve is 'out of control'","WASHINGTON: President Donald Trump renewed his attacks on the US central bank on Thursday, saying it was ""out of control"" in raising interest rates but that he had no plans to dismiss Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell.
Trump blamed the Federal Reserve for the global stocks rout that continued Thursday for a second day amid concerns about rising interest rates.

""It is a correction that I think it is caused by the Federal Reserve, with interest rates,"" Trump told reporters at the White House. ""I think the Fed is out of control.""

However, asked about Powell's future, Trump said, ""I'm not going to fire him.""

Trump named Powell to lead the central bank but can only fire him for cause.

Earlier in the day, Trump told the Fox & Friends television broadcast that the central bank was ""making a big mistake"" by being ""too aggressive"" in raising rates.

However, he acknowledged higher rates helped savers.

The comments followed his strongest criticism of the Fed late Wednesday when he said the central bank had ""gone crazy.""

US shares fell sharply on Wednesday as the Dow Jones Industrial Average lost more than 800 points in its worst tumble since February.

The rout caused a domino effect worldwide, with losses spreading to Asia and Europe on Thursday as investors remained concerned about rising rates -- which would send more buyers out of equities and into bonds -- as well as the impact of Trump's trade conflict with China on corporate profits.

After a roller coaster ride Thursday, the Dow lost another 545 points for a drop of more than two percent. London also lost nearly two percent, Frankfurt fell 1.5 percent, and Tokyo plunged nearly four percent.

White House economic adviser Larry Kudlow on Thursday said Trump's opinions had no weight on the Fed's actions.

""We know the Fed is independent. The president is not dictating policy to the Fed. He didn't say anything remotely like that,"" he said on CNBC.

And Kudlow said the Fed was managing ""the transition from ultra, ultra easy money...to something more normal,"" by raising rates gradually.

Trump has repeatedly touted the spate of Wall Street records as proof of the success of his economic program, including his confrontational trade strategy, and criticized the Fed for raising the benchmark interest rate -- three times this year -- saying it would undermine his efforts.

In fact it is largely his policies that are behind the changes: tax cuts and increased government spending are expected to juice the economy, adding to the Fed's justification to raise interest rates.

Meanwhile, trade conflicts raise costs for companies, which could hit the bottom line in quarterly earnings -- something analysts said had helped prompt Wednesday's sell-off.

The attacks on the Fed are another example of Trump breaking with recent norms. The Fed is an independent body and presidents in recent decades have avoided commenting publicly on its actions.

Powell has brushed off the comments, saying officials do not pay attention to politics.


""This is just who we are and I think who we will always be, which is, we're a group who -- we're quite removed from the political process,"" Powell said in a recent interview.


""And we just try to do the right thing for the medium and longer term for the country.""

International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde also defended the Fed on Thursday.


Raising interest rates was justified ""for those economies that are showing much improved growth, inflation that is picking up...unemployment that is extremely low,"" Lagarde told a press briefing in Bali, Indonesia where the IMF is holding its annual meeting.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/trump-says-federal-reserve-is-out-of-control/articleshow/66173716.cms"
"40","Musk denies Murdoch Jr in line for Tesla chairman post","Elon Musk replied with a tweet saying: ""This is incorrect"" after the Financial Times (FT) reported that outgoing Twenty-First Century Fox CEO James Murdoch was the lead candidate to replace him as Tesla chairman.Tesla has until November 13 to appoint an independent chairman of the board, part of settlements reached last month between Tesla, Musk and US regulators after Musk tweeted in August that he had secured funding to take the electric car maker private.


The SEC settlement capped months of debate and some investor calls for stronger oversight of Musk, whose recent erratic public behaviour raised concerns about his ability to steer the money-losing company through a rocky phase of growth. The US Securities and Exchange Commission, which said Musk's tweeted statements about going private were fraudulent, allowed the billionaire to retain his role as CEO while requiring he give up his chairmanship.


Musk had said he was considering taking Tesla private at a price of $420 a share, a number that is slang for marijuana. He tweeted the three-word denial of the FT story, on Wednesday, about six hours after the newspaper's post.

In a vote of confidence for Musk, shareholder T. Rowe Price said in a regulatory filing on Wednesday that it had raised its stake to 10.2% at the end of September from just under 7% in June. The FT cited two people briefed on discussions saying Murdoch was the lead candidate for the job. Murdoch, already an independent director of Tesla, has signalled he wants the job, the report said.


The son of Fox mogul Rupert Murdoch, he joined Tesla's board last year after years of work with media companies. He has no experience in manufacturing and has never led a company that makes cars or electric vehicles. Murdoch could not immediately be reached for comment. Tesla did not respond to a request for comment. Twenty-First Century Fox declined to comment.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/musk-denies-murdoch-jr-in-line-for-tesla-chairman-post/articleshow/66172666.cms"
"41","These are the best countries to live and work in - and to boost your salary","NEW DELHI: Moving abroad boosts the average worker’s income by $21,000, with the best-paid staff found in Switzerland, the US and Hong Kong.

That’s the conclusion in a survey showing that 45 per cent of expats said their existing job paid more internationally and 28 per cent changed locations for a promotion. In Switzerland, famous for both sky-high mountains and prices, the annual income boost totaled $61,000. Expat salaries there averaged $203,000 per year -- twice the global level.

In HSBC’s annual Expat Explorer, Singapore topped the ranking as best place to live and work for a fourth straight year, beating New Zealand, Germany and Canada. Switzerland ranked only eighth, with the high cost of raising children and difficulty making friends going against it.



“Singapore packs everything a budding expat could want into one of the world’s smallest territories,” HSBC said.


Sweden, one of the world’s most gender-equal countries, got top billing for family, while New Zealand, Spain and Taiwan led the way in the experience category.



Despite the cultural, financial and professional advantages of moving abroad, the survey of 22,318 people uncovered that women trailed on a variety of metrics.


While relocating boosted women’s income by roughly 27 per cent -- topping the increase experienced by men -- only about a quarter moved to develop their careers, compared with 47 per cent of their male counterparts. Just half worked full time, and the overall level of education was somewhat lower. Women’s average annual salary was also $42,000 lower than men’s.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/these-are-the-best-countries-to-live-and-work-in-and-to-boost-your-salary/articleshow/66162383.cms"
"42","How Donald Trump is rerouting world's oil tankers","NEW DELHI: West African and Latin American producers are sending ever-growing volumes of crude to China. America’s exports to the Asian country have slumped in favor of its neighbors. There’s an urgent global need to find replacement barrels for Iran’s, whose exports might just collapse next month.

The thing that connects the shifting flows is Trump’s foreign policy. China’s slumping purchases of American crude -- and its extra buying from elsewhere -- have coincided with a trade war between the US and the Asian country. Likewise, reimposed sanctions on Iran, which start November 4, have increased the need for the type of heavy, sour crude that the Persian Gulf state sells.

“If you combine the impact of US sanctions on Iran and the US trade war with China, it is Trump’s foreign policy which is reshaping oil flows,” said Olivier Jakob, managing director of consultancy Petromatrix GmbH. “The US is becoming a great energy power and they will use that, we are starting to see the implementation of that in different parts of the energy scene, part of that is being seen today in the oil flows.”

Oil markets are also grappling with record US output, fueled by shale production, and America’s removal in late 2015 of longstanding crude-export limits. Those shipments -- just a few hundred thousand barrels a day a few years ago -- now consistently top an average of 2 million barrels a day each month. American crude increasingly flows to markets in Asia, Europe and Latin America, data from the US Energy Information Administration show.

Shifting flows

But there have been recent changes in precisely where those barrels are going. China, the world’s largest energy consumer, in August didn’t import any US crude for the first time since September 2016, according to the most recent data from the US Census Bureau. That compares with almost 12 million barrels in July, when China was the second-largest recipient.

Shipments to South Korea soared to a record 267,000 barrels a day in August -- a 313 per cent year-on-year increase, according to Bloomberg calculations from Census data. Volumes to Japan and India rose by 198 per cent and 165 per cent, respectively. Exports to the UK, Italy and the Netherlands have also surged this year.

“The pattern of trade does look as though it’s going to ebb away from a focus on China to other Asian countries, and Europe,” said Caroline Bain, chief commodities economist at Capital Economics.

China is also increasingly turning to other regions. Colombian exports to the Asian nation rose five-fold in September, while Brazilian shipments hit their highest level this year. Chinese refiners bought 1.71 million barrels of crude a day from West Africa for October loading, the most since at least August 2011.

Sanctions’ effect

It’s not yet clear to what extent, if any, China will curb shipments of Iranian crude due to US sanctions. However, buyers in India, Japan and South Korea are reducing purchases from the Persian Gulf state. Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed Bin Salman said that the kingdom and other OPEC producers are making up for lost supply from Iran.

The demand for replacement crudes is apparent. Exports from Oman last month rose to their highest levels this year on healthy demand from China, Bloomberg tanker-tracking showed. Kuwait is directing more flows to Asia, while its shipments to the US by late September all but dried up -- the first time that’s happened since the Gulf War of 1990-91.


The curbs on Iran are having an effect on oil prices, with global benchmark Brent trading now trading near its highest level in four years. Oman was the talk of one of the oil market’s biggest gatherings last month, as its crude surged past $90 a barrel. Supertankers, which often benefit when trade flows are dislocated, are earning the most since early 2017.


Flows from Iran could drop by 2 million barrels a day, to below 1 million barrels day in November and possibly December, Energy Aspects Ltd said in a report dated October 1.



Whether it’s the need he’s created for replacement supplies from Iran, or other actions by the US president, Trump’s policies are now having a direct impact on where oil is flowing, said Eugene Lindell, an analyst at JBC Energy GmbH in Vienna.


“What you can say beyond doubt is that it’s creating lots of exotic trade flows that hadn’t been in the market before,” he said. “It’s been a major influence that has forced a change in trade flows.”","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/international-business/how-donald-trump-is-rerouting-worlds-oil-tankers/articleshow/66161465.cms"
"43","US wants to prohibit data localisation, top trade official says amid looming RBI directive","WASHINGTON: The US wants to prohibit data localisation to ensure that there is a free flow of information across borders, a senior Trump administration official has said, amidst reports that major American IT companies are up in arms against the latest Indian directive which kicks off next week.

Data localisation is an act of storing data on any device that is physically present within the borders of a particular country where the data was generated.

The Reserve Bank of India (RBI), in a circular in April, said all system providers will have to ensure that the entire data relating to payment systems operated by them are stored in a system only in India. It gave time till October 15 to comply with the mandate.

""We want to have prohibitions on data localisation to ensure that there's free flow of information, free flow of data across borders, disciplines around countries requiring companies to give up their source code, permanent ban on taxation or duties on digital transmissions,"" Dennis Shea, Deputy US Trade Representative and US Ambassador to the WTO, told a Washington audience on Friday.

""And by the way, South Africa and India want to rethink the current moratorium on those duties,"" Shea said in response to a question at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), a top American think-tank.

American financial companies are believed to have approached the administration against an RBI directive which, beginning October 15, requires them to store in India any payment-related data from transactions that take place inside the country.

India has rejected their request of mirroring.

""If implemented, this policy will put an unnecessary burden on American companies and hurt consumers, who will endure higher costs and increased cybersecurity risks,"" Republican Strategist Andy Surabian, who is also a political adviser to Donald Trump Jr, wrote in BreitBart News this week.

""And they are planning to do all of this in spite of the unprecedented level of economic support the US has provided India over the course of decades. The Trump administration should stand up to these reckless actions, just like they have done in other situations when Americans were getting bullied and pushed around,"" Surabian demanded.

During his CSIS appearance, Shea did not specifically pointed out India on the data localisation issue, but made his views pretty clear where the Trump administration stands on this issue.


Shea said the US is very engaged at the multilateral issue and has a very high-ambition approach to that.


The general view is that the negotiation part of this process may begin early next year, or perhaps a ministerial statement around Davos.



Other members of the WTO, he said, have lower ambitions so ""how this works out still remains to be seen,"" he added.


Mobile messaging platform WhatsApp has said it has built a system that stores payments-related data in India, in line with RBI's data localisation policy.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/us-wants-to-prohibit-data-localisation-top-trade-official-says-amid-looming-rbi-directive/articleshow/66192350.cms"
"44","TCS to see 28,000 campus hires, highest in 3 years","BENGALURU: Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) is giving offers to 28,000 campus recruits this year, the highest number of offers it has made to freshers in the last three years, signalling a strong demand pipeline for its services.

In each of the last two years, the company made 20,000 offers to freshers. “We are seeing good demand in terms of business and growth. We have already hired 16,000 people in the first half of the year,” said Ajoy Mukherjee, executive VP and head of global human resources at TCS.


The company made a net addition of 10,227 people in the September quarter, its highest in 12 quarters. The attrition rate is relatively low at 10.9%, which prompted CEO Rajesh Gopinathan to say on Thursday that the company was a gold standard in talent retention. Given that, a lot of the fresh hiring will be net additions and not hiring to fill up positions vacated by those leaving.


Two sectors that have been weak, BFSI (banking, financial services & insurance) and retail, have made a comeback, which is helping to drive demand for TCS.



The company has given 100% quarterly variable allowance (QVA) to its employees for the September quarter. An email from Mukherjee to employees also said that individual payout for grades equivalent to C3A (mid-level) and above may vary depending on business unit and performance. The QVA will be reflected in the November payroll. TCS has given 100% or higher variable payouts in the last four quarters.


The company said onsite hiring across all geographies has been net positive. “We want to highlight our journey on multi-location agile teams. TCS follows a location-independent agile strategy. We are hiring onsite and our hiring has been net positive,” Mukherjee said. Asked if TCS is planning to increase the compensation for regular entry-level hires, Mukherjee said it was too early to comment.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/tcs-to-see-28000-campus-hires-highest-in-3-years/articleshow/66189403.cms"

In terms on year-on-year (y-o-y) growth, TCS net profit rose to 22.6 per cent, when compared to Rs 6,446 crore a year earlier.

Analysts, on average, expected a consolidated net profit of Rs 7,902 crore, according to Refinitiv Eikon data.

Revenue from operations (y-o-y) rose 20.7 per cent to Rs 36,854 crore in Q2. Strong revenue growth was also seen in its banking, financial services and insurance (BFSI) and retail segments.

TCS chief executive and managing director Rajesh Gopinathan said, ""We are very pleased with our all-round strong performance in Q2.

"47","Rupee depreciation: Tata Motors to take a call on price hike later this year","NEW DELHI: Even as rupee depreciation is adding to the stress in the automobile market, Tata Motors will evaluate passing on its impact to consumers only around December to avoid price hike during the festive season, a senior company official said Wednesday.

The company, which introduced an upgraded version of its compact sedan Tigor priced between Rs 5.20 lakh and Rs 7.38 lakh (ex-showroom), is also looking at launching a premium hatchback next year to widen its product offering.

""That's a stress. Till a point we can absorb and we will absorb, but otherwise we are running a sustainable project and we have to win sustainably,"" Tata Motors president, passenger vehicles business unit, Mayank Pareek told PTI.

He was responding to a query on the impact of rupee depreciation against the dollar on the company's cost of imports.

Pareek further said, ""We have about 25-30 per cent import content both directly and indirectly.""

On Tuesday, the rupee slumped by 33 paise to finish at a fresh lifetime low of 74.39 against the US dollar on high crude oil prices, strengthening of the greenback and unabated foreign fund outflows.

When asked if the company planned to pass on the impact to customers, he said, ""We will watch but for the festive season we would not like to disturb the pricing.""

By year-end, around December, the company could decide on the price hike, Pareek said adding, ""Certainly we will have to do, but we cannot completely pass on the entire burden to customers.""

Commenting on the market sentiment, he said there is ""stress"" due to factors such as high fuel prices and non-availability of vehicle finance.

""However, at Tata Motors we are looking forward to a good festive season on the back of the actions we have taken up, such as introduction of new products to build on the growth we have had this year,"" Pareek said.

In the second quarter, when the industry PV sales have declined by 3.2 per cent, Tata Motors grew by 19.1 per cent, he added.

On the new Tigor, Pareek said the company expects the model to be a strong player in the compact sedan segment which has witnessed growth in the last two years after witnessing a decline previously.

""Customers had moved to compact SUV from compact sedan. However, in the last two-three years with the introduction of new exciting products, people have again started buying products in this segment,"" he added.

The new Tigor will be available in petrol version powered by 1.2 litre engine and diesel with 1.05 litre powertrain.


The petrol variants of the model are priced between Rs 5.20 lakh and Rs 6.65 lakh, while the diesel trims are tagged between Rs 6.09 lakh and Rs 7.38 lakh.


On new product plans, Pareek said the company is looking to fill gaps in its portfolio to enhance its presence in the overall market segments.



""Around three years ago, we were present in only 50 per cent of the market. We have increased in to around 55-60 per cent now. The aim is to be present in 90 per cent of the overall PV segment,"" he said.


While Tata Motors is gearing up to launch its SUV Harrier early next year, Pareek said, ""We are still not present in the premium hatchback segment, which is also something we will look to address next year.""","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/rupee-depreciation-tata-motors-to-take-a-call-on-price-hike-later-this-year/articleshow/66149024.cms"
"48","Record fuel prices hit petrol, diesel demand in September","NEW DELHI: India's monthly diesel consumption fell for the first time in 10 months year-on-year in September, while petrol sales grew by the least in four months as record high pump prices dented demand, government data showed on Friday.

Lower local sales of petrol and diesel curbed growth in India's overall fuel demand to 1.1 per cent in September, despite higher sales of liquefied petroleum gas and jet fuel.

India's fuel consumption, a proxy for oil demand, totalled 16.54 million tonnes in September, a decline of about 1.3 per cent from August, data from the Petroleum Planning and Analysis Cell (PPAC) of the oil ministry showed.

A sharp fall in the value of the Indian rupee and soaring oil prices led to record high pump prices of diesel and petrol, forcing the government to cut taxes on them and asking retailers to cut marketing margins by Re 1 a litre.

Diesel sales, which account for about 40 percent of refined fuels used in India, declined by 0.8 per cent to 6.03 million tonnes in September, the data showed.

Growth in sales of gasoline, widely used for transportation, eased to 4.2 per cent to 2.23 million tonnes from the same month last year, as demand for passenger vehicles fell 5.6 percent in September from a year ago.

""It may have some price impact but we need to analyse that... last month growth in petrol and diesel sales were impacted as (in) September 2017 there was a robust growth,"" said M K Surana, Chairman of Hindustan Petroleum Corp.

Industrial slowdown

Lower consumption of diesel also indicates slowing industrial activity, as it is used in industries and mining.


India's industrial output in August grew 4.3 per cent from a year earlier, compared to the downwardly revised 6.5 per cent year-on-year increase in July.


Although overall monsoon rains were below average, floods in parts of India restricted mobility and hit demand from farmers who use diesel-fuelled generators to power pumps for wells.

""Seasonally it is not a high demand period,"" Senthil Kumaran, senior oil analyst at FGE, said, adding that the worst is over for Indian fuel buyers in term of prices as the government might cut taxes further.


""We see a marginal impact of pricing in September sales but going forward from now to until March we expect the government to continue to take measures to reduce the impact of higher prices through reduction of taxes ahead of elections next year.""","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/record-fuel-prices-hit-petrol-diesel-demand-in-september/articleshow/66193478.cms"
"49","Why India wants investors to fill its caves with oil","NEW DELHI: Amid the volatility in the global crude prices, the government is planning to increase its capacity of oil reserves and is seeking investments from oil traders and producers.

Caves of oil: They are called strategic petroleum reserves (SPRs). India has three underground storage facilities (built at the cost of Rs 4,100 crore) that can store 5.33 million tonnes of crude oil.

Oil in caves: The one in Visakhapatnam is filled with 1.33 MMT of oil purchased by the government, another in Mangalore (with 1.50 MMT capacity) has been half-filled by the government and another half leased to Abu Dhabi National Oil Co, and the third in Padur, Karnataka, is built but awaiting oil for storage.

Dig some more: Cabinet early this year approved two more SPRs: a 4.4 million tonnes SPR at Chandikhol in Odisha and a 2.5 million tonnes facility at Padur in Karnataka.


What now? Centre is seeking $1.5 billion in investments from global oil producers and traders to build the two additional reserves. It plans to hold roadshows in New Delhi, Singapore and London this month to draw investors. Getting private investors will lessen the financial burden on the government.


Private or public? While the oil will be filled by private companies, India will reserve the first right over the crude. Government-owned Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd (formed in 2006) will collaborate with private entities to invest in the project.



Why? For India’s energy security (we import 85% of our crude needs), and to insulate us from external price and supply shocks. The oil in the three SPRs already built can help meet 10 days of crude requirement, and the two planned ones can hold supply of about 12 more days.


What crisis? There was one during the Gulf War in 1990, when our oil reserves were adequate only for three days. Plus, others like US, Japan, China, UK and EU have it too.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/why-india-wants-investors-to-fill-its-caves-with-oil/articleshow/66192770.cms"
"50","Retail inflation inches up to 3.77% in September; August IIP at 4.3%","NEW DELHI: Retail inflation in September marginally moved up to 3.77 per cent in September from 3.69 per cent in August, data released by the ministry of statistics and programme implementation showed.

The inflation numbers inched up due to higher food and fuel prices and a depreciating rupee.



A Reuters poll had suggested that the retail inflation in September may accelerate to the Reserve Bank of India's medium-term target of 4.00 per cent, higher than August's 10-month low of 3.69 per cent.

""The story on food has been very much comfortable this year. So much so that it could help mitigate a lot of pain because of the rise in crude prices and a falling rupee,"" Tushar Arora, senior economist, HDFC Bank told news agency Reuters.

Another set of data released showed that the August industrial output (IIP) grew at 4.3 per cent in August, down from 4.8 per cent posted in the same period last year.


When compared with July 2018, the industrial production growth or factory growth slipped to a three-month low in August mainly due to a sharp decline in the mining sector output and poor offtake of capital goods.


The IIP growth is the lowest since May when industrial production grew at 3.9 per cent. Factory growth expanded by 6.8 per cent in June and 6.5 per cent in July.



The RBI last week held interest rates unchanged, surprising many market watchers who anticipated a third consecutive hike, but shifted its stance from ""neutral"" to ""calibrated tightening"" in a nod to pricing pressures.

"51","India targets oil traders for $1.5 billion emergency oil reserve","NEW DELHI: India is seeking $1.5 billion of investments from global oil producers and traders to build additional emergency crude reserves that will act as a buffer against volatility in oil prices.

The plan is to build underground caverns that can hold a combined 6.5 million tons of crude at two locations, Indian Strategic Petroleum Reserves Ltd chief executive Officer HPS Ahuja said. The state-run ISPRL will collaborate with private entities, who will invest in the project, he said.

Getting investors to build the storage facilities will lessen the strain on state finances and help Prime Minister Narendra Modi’s government meet its budget goals, while expanding strategic petroleum reserves to shield the economy from oil-price volatility. India, which meets almost 85 per cent of its crude needs through imports, this month cut taxes on fuel sales to lower the burden of high oil prices on consumers.

“We are taking the commercial model for building and filling the caverns, which will provide opportunity to the investor to make some profits,” Ahuja said. “India will continue to reserve first right over the crude stored in these caverns.”


The two new reserves include 4 million tons of storage at Chandikhol in the eastern state of Odisha and a 2.5 million-ton facility at Padur in southern India’s Karnataka.


India has built 5.33 million tons of underground reserves in three locations, including Padur, under an earlier phase that can meet 9.5 days of the country’s oil needs.

"52","OPEC moves to calm oil supply fears as India slams high prices","NEW DELHI: OPEC again sought to reassure markets after one of its biggest customers complained about the pain of high prices.

“There is no cause for alarm,” OPEC secretary-general Mohammad Barkindo said Thursday, adding that India had sent a letter bemoaning the state of the oil market. While insisting supplies are sufficient, he neglected to specify how much extra production OPEC intends -- or is able -- to pump, an omission that’s undermining its effort to calm prices.

OPEC nations and its allies with spare capacity have given their assurance that “they are ready and willing to continue to make sure that the market remains well supplied,” Barkindo said at the Oil & Money conference in London. The group is keen to assuage any fears among its customers, and will hold talks with India on October 17, he said.

Crude surged to a four-year high earlier this month on concern US sanctions on Iran, along with chronic supply losses in Venezuela, could lead to a shortage. Emerging economies, most notably India, are bearing the brunt of the rally, which comes when they’re already contending with currency depreciation and the fallout from trade disputes.

Rupee crashes to all-time low of 73.81 on capital outflows, surging oil prices


Output boost

Saudi Arabia, the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries’ top producer, and ally Russia have signaled they’re doing their bit to mitigate losses -- pumping an extra 1 million barrels a day following their June deal to boost production. But traders are worried the Saudis aren’t acting quickly enough -- or may lack the capacity -- to fill a shortfall.


The market balance may be “fragile” but that’s not a result of fundamentals, Barkindo said. OPEC sees a possible rebuild of oil stockpiles next year, he said, conceding that it remains “very concerned” about the level of spare production capacity following years of under-investment.


The oil-market balance is continually being tested, but prices have reacted to perceptions of scant supply, not real shortages, he said.



The 25 countries in the coalition of OPEC and non-members -- known as OPEC+ -- are still working on turning their ad-hoc alliance into something more permanent. OPEC representatives, known as governors, will discuss the framework when they meet October 23 in Vienna, while officials from non-OPEC will visit the Austrian capital for follow-up talks on November 7. The coalition aims to have a more detailed plan by the time ministers meet in December.


“We are now gradually but steadily seeing the brighter path ahead,” Barkindo said. That’s “despite some of the bumps, despite some of the occasional clouds that have gathered.”","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/opec-moves-to-calm-oil-supply-fears-as-india-slams-high-prices/articleshow/66175278.cms"

"55","Unchanged repo rate to help realty revival: Industry experts","MUMBAI: The Reserve Bank of India's (RBI) decision to keep the repo rate unchanged will give a much needed boost to the real estate sector which is witnessing signs of revival in the past six months, industry experts said.

The apex bank on Friday kept the repo rate unchanged at 6.50 per cent, despite global and domestic macro-economic headwinds of rising interest rates in the US, rising crude prices, threat of crude oil fuelled inflation, weaker currency and FII outflows, Knight Frank India chairman and managing director Shishir Baijal said.

Sensex battered, rupee breaches 74-mark as RBI keeps repo rate unchanged


""The rates remaining unchanged has opened a great opportunity for buyers. As the festive season is also round the corner and property rates are fairly low across the country, it will trigger the home buying sentiment in the market. Also the rupee has depreciated to its all time low to 74 against dollar should attract NRI property buyers,"" Poddar Housing and Development managing director Rohit Poddar said.

Echoing similar views CREDAI national president Jaxay Shah said the decision to keep the repo rate unchanged is a relief to the developers, home buyers and real estate stakeholders at large.

Rupee sinks to all-time low, breaches 74-mark against US dollar


""However, the economy is too precariously poised for real estate to pull itself by its bootstraps. We hope in particular for decisive steps to end the credit freeze,"" he added.

Welcoming the decision, CBRE India and South East Asia chairman Anshuman Magazine said that any hike in repo rate would have impacted consumption sentiments and also the real estate sector.

""Also, the change in stance of the RBI from neutral to calibrated tightening is an indication of the intent to keep inflation levels in check,"" he said.

Voicing similar concerns, Colliers International India managing director Joe Verghese opined that considering the mood of uneasiness in the banking and financial sector, the RBI has taken the right step by not going in for another hike in interest rates at this stage.

""This would have only further dampened the sentiments across the real estate industry, especially with the festive season round the corner,"" he said.

House of Hiranandani chairman and MD Surendra Hiranandani said the hike might have impacted consumption sentiments negatively ahead of the festive season.

""From a consumers perspective, home loan rates are attractive so they must utilise this opportunity and make their purchases by cashing in on deals in the market,"" he said.

Group CEO Housing.com Dhruv Agarwala felt that as we are near the festive season, a rate cut would have allowed potential buyers to plan better for their investments in the property market for the current financial year.

Property consultant JLL CEO and country head Ramesh Nair said that for home buyers, the timing could not have been better as lending rates are not expected to increase from current levels.

""Besides providing a major fillip to buyer sentiment, RBI's move should also translate into boosting demand. With the latest GDP numbers indicating better growth prospects for the Indian economy, we hope the central bank will have enough elbow room to make it conducive for home buyers,"" he added.


Paradigm Realty managing director Parth Mehta said this pause on the repo rate is a temporary relief and is not a burden for the home buyers especially during this festive season.


Knight Frank India CMD Shishir Baijal said: ""While we are in a rising interest rate cycle now, the pause will provide a temporary relief to the home buyer sentiment and support the festive season demand.""

"56","‘GST makes jt development of realty projects unviable’","NEW DELHI: Joint development of a real estate project, including housing, has become unviable due to inclusion of such a practice under the Goods and Services Tax (GST) regime, say developers. Joint Development Agreements (JDAs) now attract GST at the rate of 18%.

According to the new regime, the land owner renders a ‘service’ to the developer via the transfer of development (construction) rights and therefore GST is applicable at the JDA execution stage itself, said a CEO of a real estate firm from Mumbai, whose efforts to enter into agreement with a farmer in Gurgaon fell through. “This increases the cost of a project, making it unviable in the present market scenario,” said the CEO, who declined to be named.

There are two common types of JDAs. One is area-sharing JDA. Under which, the developer pays the land owner a deposit and hands over a certain percentage of the developed area in the project to secure development rights.

Another model is the revenue-sharing JDA, where the developer pays the land owner a deposit and a share of the revenues from the project to secure the development rights.

In the pre-GST era, revenue-sharing JDAs were outside the ambit of service tax and area-sharing JDAs would attract service tax at the time of approvals for the project, once the apartments/units under the land owner’s area share were identified.

But in the new regime, the GST at the rate of 18% on the market value of the deal has to be paid at the time of execution of the deal itself, which in turn results in cash flow concerns for both parties, said Pankaj Goyal, director of Express Builders.


Suppose a developer is constructing 200 apartments under JDA with an agreement that 100 apartments would be given back to the land owner after finishing the construction to compensate for the value of land.


If the cost of each apartment is Rs one crore, the deal size would be treated as of Rs 100 crore and a GST of Rs 18 crore would be levied.

As land costs have increased, JDAs have become a popular and preferred format for real estate development in the country and helped address the need for housing stock in a sustainable manner, said CREDAI chairman Getamber Anand, who is also the CMD of ATS infrastructure.


“The JDA model enables the developer to share market risk with land owner and reduces capital outlay,” he said.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/gst-makes-jt-development-of-realty-projects-unviable/articleshow/66061982.cms"

"58","Government ups import duty on telecom gear to trim trade deficit","NEW DELHI: The government on Thursday raised customs duty on eight components and equipment used by the telecom sector as it sought to reduce the dependence on imported goods in a sector with burgeoning demand, which could outstrip the value of oil imports in the coming years.

This is the second round of duty increase in as many weeks to cut down on what is viewed as ""non-essential"" imports and save precious dollars at a time when the trade and the current account deficit are widening and piling pressure on the rupee, which has plunged over 15% against the US dollar, making it the worst performing Asian currency so far in 2018.

The increase in import tariff will impact prices of key equipment such as base stations, optical transport equipment and Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) gear. The government has already raised the import duty on mobile phones, which have been spared in this round, tax consultants said.



""The increased import duty rates on some of these products would entail an additional burden on the telecom industry, where these goods are imported,"" said Abhishek Jain, tax partner at consulting firm EY.


India's telecom equipment imports were estimated at close to $22 billion during the last financial year, according to data compiled by the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (Trai). During this period, oil imports were pegged at $88 billion, and are expected to rise significantly this year due to a spike in global prices, which continue to hover above the $80-per-barrel mark.


The only positive is the increased assembly of mobile phones in the country, with several global players such as Samsung and Xiaomi setting up units here, while other such as Apple are yet to firm up plans, despite being in talks for several years.



In the last round, the government had increased import duty on air conditioners, washing machines, refrigerators, textiles and diamonds in an attempt to trim current account deficit, which is the difference between exports and imports and other inflows such as investments and remittances.


The measures were, however, seen to be meagre as the value of these imports were estimated at a little over $12 billion, with trade experts fearing that the source of shipments would move to countries such as Vietnam and Korea with which India has free trade agreements.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/govt-ups-import-duty-on-tele-gear-to-trim-trade-deficit/articleshow/66172332.cms"
"59","Ericsson row: RCom says relief from TDSAT, can proceed with spectrum sale sans bank guarantee","NEW DELHI: Reliance Communications said Wednesday it has got relief from telecom tribunal and can now complete its planned spectrum sale, whose proceeds will be used to make payments to Ericsson India and RITL minority investors. RCom, in a regulatory filing to the BSE, said it will receive Rs 975 crore from sale of spectrum, and that it will pay Ericsson Rs 550 crore and RITL (Reliance Infratel) minority investors Rs 230 crore from the spectrum trading proceeds.

""Reliance Communications has been granted relief by the...Telecom Disputes Settlement and Appellate Tribunal (TDSAT) vide its interim order dated 1 October 2018, whereby...TDSAT has stayed the demand of bank guarantee of Rs 2,900 crore by the Department of Telecommunications,"" it said.

The Anil Ambani promoted RCom noted it had challenged the ""unjustly sought security for the alleged demands"" by the Telecom Department with regard to spectrum usage charges.

""After multiple hearings since August 28, 2018 the Hon'ble TDSAT, vide its interim order dated October 1, 2018 has stayed the said demand and directed DoT to expeditiously grant its approval for trading of the spectrum,"" RCom added.

The debt-laden firm pointed out that 38 secured lenders of the group have already approved the sale of the said spectrum.

""...and the proceeds thereof will be used for making payments to Ericsson India Private Limited and to RITL Minority Investors, as per settlement terms,"" it said.

The company, yesterday, said it had learnt that unsecured creditor Ericsson India had filed a contempt petition on October 1, in Supreme Court in relation to the settlement amount of Rs 550 crore to be paid by RCom.

RCom had also stated that it filed an application on September 28 in the apex court seeking 60 more days for making payment to the Swedish telecom equipment maker.

That matter is slated to be heard on October 4, it pointed out.


""The extension has been sought purely due to the fact that, as approved by 38 secured lenders, and as per RCOM's undertaking, Ericsson is to be paid from the sales proceeds of spectrum being traded by RCom, and such sale could not be completed as yet owing to factors beyond the control of RCOM,"" RCom has stated in the filing on Tuesday.


The company was, at that time, awaiting the copy of the order passed by TDSAT.


Last year, Reliance Communications (RCom) signed a pact with Reliance Jio for sale of wireless spectrum, tower, fibre and media convergence nodes assets - the proceeds of which were to be used to pare debt.


From that deal, RCom has thus far announced the completion of the sale of optical fibre assets worth Rs 3,000 crore and sale of its media convergence nodes worth Rs 2,000 crore to Mukesh Ambani-backed Reliance Jio Infocomm.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/ericsson-row-rcom-says-relief-from-tdsat-can-proceed-with-spectrum-sale-sans-bank-guarantee/articleshow/66055435.cms"
"60","Ericsson petitions Supreme Court to prevent Anil Ambani from leaving India over pending dues","NEW DELHI: Swedish telecom equipment company Ericsson has petitioned the Supreme Court to prevent Anil Ambani and two senior executives from his group from leaving the country after accusing them of willfully defaulting in previously- promised payment of Rs 550 crore + by alleged abuse of process of law.

The company was to get the payment in lieu of the business it had done with the embattled Anil Ambani group that has debt running up to Rs 45,000 crore.

Ericsson had earlier agreed to scale down its dues towards Ambani’s group from Rs 1,600 crore to Rs 550 crore as part of a court-monitored settlement which promised the payment by September 30 this year. However, since the payment did not come from RCom, it has decided to approach the top court on the matter once again.

Ericsson settlement deal row: RCom seeks 60 days more for payment citing pending spectrum sale


“They have no respect for the law of the nation, and have abused the process of law,” Ericsson said, requesting the court to initiate contempt proceedings against the Indian company and its management, while preventing them from leaving the country. “… prevent any of these persons from leaving the country without the specific permission of this court… these directions are necessary to secure the ends of justice.”


Anil Ambani had managed to strike a deal with elder brother Mukesh Ambani’s Reliance Jio with expected inflows of up to Rs 25,000 crore by sale of assets such as spectrum, tower, and fibre. However, the deal has faced trouble at the telecom ministry which is seeking bank guarantees worth Rs 2,900 crore from the company over spectrum usage charges before allowing it.



In a statement to the stock exchange, Anil’s Reliance Communications (RCom) termed Ericsson’s latest petition as “unwarranted” and said it has sought an extension of 60 days to make the payment. This, it said, was warranted since it has decided to challenge the telecom ministry’s demand of bank guarantees.

"64","Link investments to goals, not to market situations","When the stock markets are volatile, you always hear conflicting views. As risk is an important part of investing, it is easier to discuss risk when the going is good. But, when simple investors see the price of their holdings fall each day, it is tough to make decisions. Here are some pointers to think about.

First, avoid the temptation to time the markets. Many investors are convinced that if they did not get the timing right, they would make no money. People who booked profits have allocated too much to a specific product. What would you do with the profits that you book? If you are reinvesting, you are adjusting the amount and that is revision. If you are keeping the money in the bank, that is rebalancing. So, consider your choices strategically, and not tactically. Align your decisions to your goals, not the markets.

Second, do not try to catch a falling knife. Professional investors have the benefit of systems that track their positions and profits. They have to implement tactics that can help them compete in a tough market. Simple investors, saving for life’s goals, should not take risks with falling markets.

Third, act with deliberation. Do not get carried away by the panic selling seen in trading counters. Traders take short-term positions and pay margins and incur interest costs on open positions. As prices fall, it is tougher to find money for margin while losing on an open position. That is why they sell quickly and panic in a market crash. Don’t imagine yourself in a position that is not your reality. Your funds are yours and not borrowed.

Fourth, a falling tide takes all. After the IL&FS fiasco, non-banking stocks fell due to the fear of downgrades and defaults across the board. This means that the market is reworking the valuation of stocks, based on new information. It is not an immediate buying opportunity, though many will be tempted to see good stocks selling at lower prices. A bad balance sheet cannot be corrected overnight. Do not buy or sell in haste.

Fifth, watch carefully for clues. When the noise settles down, and there is an actual plan of action about the defaulting large business, only then real recovery will begin. So, it is not necessary for long-term investors to act preemptively.

Sixth, evaluate what you have carefully. If your stocks are falling steeply and failing to recover even with good news, you may have to book your losses. In a risky market, quality matters the most. Do not hold junk, accept your mistakes and correct them.


Seventh, if you are a systematic investor, putting in small amounts in a diversified mutual fund every month, your strategy is good enough. The value of your holdings will fall as the markets fall, but that should not worry you if your financial goals are into the future. Do not discontinue your SIP.


Eighth, if you have a financial goal that is immediate, and are stuck in equity because you wanted to make some quick gains, you are in bad luck. Such events show up the risks inherent in trying to make above average returns. For simple investors it is good for the money to make average returns. Simple and boring is a good investment strategy.

Ninth, if you have a lump sum to invest—sold a property, retirement proceeds—remain in cash. In a risky market, cash is the best choice. As the fog clears, the time to make investment will arrive. Do not let yourself be pushed into action. These are times when the best strategy is to do little, if at all.

"65","Don’t tinker with your SIPs even as the markets are down","NEW DELHI: Fear has returned to Dalal Street. Caught in a perfect storm of weak macro-economic numbers, the IL&FS crisis and fear of more defaults, markets have retreated more than 15 per cent from their alltime high levels achieved in the last week of August. The 806-point drop in the Sensex + on 4 October was the fifth biggest single-day loss registered by the BSE benchmark in the past five years.

In Mumbai, newbie investor Rashmi Rajagopal is feeling jittery about her portfolio of equity funds. She started investing in equity funds about a year ago. “My portfolio grew handsomely till last month, but is now in the red. Frankly, I don’t know whether I should stop my SIPs, withdraw my money or continue investing,” says the 44-year-old marketing manager.

Took control of IL&FS to avert 'catastrophic' damage, says government

It’s a dilemma small investors like Rajagopal face every time the markets tumble. Unfortunately, they usually end up making the wrong choices. Some stop their SIPs in equity funds while others redeem their investments to avoid further losses. “Investors who started SIPs this year will obviously be in the red. But if they redeem now, they will turn temporary losses into permanent ones,” cautions Raj Khosla, Managing Director, MyMoneyMantra.


MARKET TIMING IS A MYTH

Volatility is inherent to equities. It is practically impossible to predict how markets will behave on a certain day. ET Wealth back-tested to see whether mutual fund investors should try to time the market by getting out before they crash. An investor who started SIPs in a diversified equity fund five years ago and continued investing irrespective of market movements would have earned a return of 10.5 per cent. But an investor who managed to avoid the 10 biggest falls in the Sensex by getting out a day before the crash would have earned 13.8 per cent returns (see graphic).

The findings of the study suggest that timing the market can yield good profits. But the study has assumed that Perfect Timer was able to correctly predict all the 10 market crashes. Besides the impeccable clairvoyance, he also had the guts to reinvest the entire redemption amount on the next SIP date. “He is an absolute Nostradamus. We should hire him as a fund manager,” jokes the CEO of a large mutual fund house.

In the real world, one doesn’t get it right all the time. Even if Perfect Timer missed one of the crashes, some of the gains would have been shaved off from the overall returns. Also, an investor who got jittery by a 2-3 per cent fall in the index would probably not reinvest in a hurry. Cautious Timer is assumed to have skipped one SIP after the crash before he gathered courage to re-enter the market. He reinvested the redeemed amount along with the missed SIP on the following SIP date. Not surprisingly, he did not make more than what Regular Investor earned by simply continuing his SIPs over the five-year tenure.

SHOULD YOU BE BULLISH?

Few realise that if their goals are very long-term, a fall in the market today is actually an opportunity to buy more at lower prices. By that logic, people should be rushing to invest every time markets plunge. “My goals are 15-20 years away so these short-term dips don’t bother me much. In fact, I see market crashes as opportunities and put in lump sum amounts to supplement my SIPs when markets are down,” says Pune-based Amol Mahulikar. The 41-year-old IT professional is saving for his kids’ higher education and his own retirement.


This makes obvious sense, but it is best not to tinker with your ongoing SIPs. The Bullish Timer in our study invested more on the day of the crash by advancing the next month’s SIP. He makes marginally more than the Regular SIP investor.


INVESTMENT HORIZON MATTERS



It is often said that when it comes to long-term investing, no other asset class can match the potential of equities. At the same time, equities are not a good choice if your goal is very near. Financial planners say the tenure of the investment is critical. “Investors with short-term goals (1-2 years away) should stay clear of equity-oriented instruments for they are risky,” says Deepti Goel, Associate Partner, Alpha Capital.


On the other hand, if the goal is more than 8-10 years away, one should avoid fixed income investments for they can’t match the returns that equities can offer. Stock market corrections should not push investors away from the wealth creation potential of equities.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/dont-tinker-with-your-sips/articleshow/66113370.cms"
"66","Government extends deadline for filing Income Tax return, audit report till October 15","NEW DELHI: The government on Monday extended by a fortnight till October 15 the deadline for filing Income Tax return (ITR) and audit report for financial year 2017-18.


The Central Board of Direct Taxes (CBDT) had received representations from stakeholders seeking extension of the last date for filing of returns by taxpayers whose accounts have to be audited.


“The CBDT extends the ‘due date' for filing of ITRs as well as reports of Audit (which were required to be filed by the said specified date) from September 30, 2018 to October 15, 2018 in respect of the said categories of taxpayers,” the CBDT said in a statement.



However, there shall be no extension of the due date for the purpose of section 234A (Explanation 1) of the I-T Act, 1961 pertaining to interest for defaults in furnishing return, and the assessee shall remain liable for payment of interest as per provisions of section 234A of the Act, it added.


As per data released by CBDT earlier, ITR filing by salaried taxpayers and those opting for presumptive income scheme surged 71 per cent to 5.42 crore till August 31. These categories of taxpayers had to furnish their ITRs for financial year 2017-18 by last month.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/government-extends-deadline-for-filing-itr-audit-report-till-october-15/articleshow/65935669.cms"
"67","How to win financial freedom","A lot of people ask for different kinds of financial advice. And, there’s one request that is asked often and is really hard to respond to, and this has to do with financial independence. It may appear to be a vague term, but signifies roughly similar things to different people.

There are many degrees of financial freedom, and the highest is not having to work to earn for the rest of your life. While there are many who do not have to work but for most of us, it takes our entire working lives to reach that stage, if at all we reach it.

The simple fact is that if we save and invest with a modicum of planning, lesser degrees of financial freedom can be achieved earlier in life, and can be just as rewarding.

However, with many among the urban middle-class suddenly losing their jobs, India is clearly passing through a job crisis. Youngsters are finding it difficult to find jobs, or are forced to accept low-quality employment. Middle-level executives are being shunted out of employment because employers think they can be replaced at a lower cost. Things were different earlier as most salaried people were confident in their jobs and sure of frequent increments.


One can’t predict when the employment situation will change for the better. However, those of us who change their attitude towards money, savings and personal finance will be much happier, and will be able to navigate through this new, uncertain world much more easily.


Unfortunately, the proportion of younger earners in their 20s and 30s who save, is quite low. In fact, as soon as people start earning, they take on loan EMIs, essentially spending future savings today. The way out, whether the job environment improves or not, is saving as much as possible at the beginning of one’s career. This will immeasurably improve one’s finances later. Those who have savings that are equivalent to even a year or two’s expenses (including any loan EMIs) feel much more relaxed about their careers.

The article is incomplete, it doesn''t provide any specific suggestions or plan to achieve the financial freedom.. Why such below standard articles are published..?

The first step to garner enough savings is to save, and the second step is to save enough. Unfortunately, many of us don’t get started for years after we start earning. Given the hyper-persuasive consumerist culture that surrounds us, it’s not easy to start—and there’s no other way to achieve financial independence.

Now once the government completes the long-pending process of Internet-in-sky, domestic flyers can also surf the net.

The airline has inducted its first Boeing 737 Max aircraft. SpiceJet had ordered up to 205 of these planes last year in a deal worth $22 billion. Each of SpiceJet's Max will be ""equipped with Satcom to enable internet on board services,"" it said. Boeing claims the Max is 14% more fuel efficient than earlier generation B737s and will have reduced maintenance costs. The low-cost carrier plans to expand its network with this plane, including flying it to Hong Kong from next month. Incidentally, the first aircraft's registration is VT-MAX.

SpiceJet chairman Ajay Singh said: ""We are excited to take delivery of our very first 737 MAX 8. (This) is a huge milestone in SpiceJet’s journey. These new airplanes will enable us to open new routes, while reducing fuel and engineering costs, as well as emissions. The 737 MAX will dramatically reduce noise pollution and greenhouse gas emissions. Passengers will benefit from a large number of premium seats and, for the first time in India, broadband internet on board.”




SpiceJet says its MAX aircrafts comes equipped with Satcom that will enable internet on board services as soon as regulatory and government approvals are in place. The MAX 8 can fly up to 3,500 nautical miles which is approximately 19% more than 737-800 enabling the airline to fly to newer destinations.



""SpiceJet’s 737 MAX 8 comes with all-new interiors. Inspired by the 787 Dreamliner’s advanced aesthetics.... Instead of shelf-type stow compartments bordering the aisle, the 737 Boeing Sky Interior features stow bins that tuck up and are out of the way when closed. This results in a roomier, more open in-flight environment with unobstructed views, whether passengers are standing or seated,"" the airline said.


""An advanced light-emitting diode lighting scheme washes the ceiling with blue light, which suggests an open sky overhead and makes the airplane feel more spacious, besides... larger windows,"" it added.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/spicejet-inducts-plane-with-onboard-wifi-to-resume-service-after-government-approval/articleshow/66175491.cms"

Civil aviation secretary, RN Choubey also said the safety audit that the Director General of Civil Aviation ordered on domestic airlines ""did not find any backlog of any safety steps that they should have taken.""

""Whenever there is a need for financial support to Air India, it will be examined on need basis and such financial support on need basis will be provided. I only wish to tell you that all support will be provided.

Air India's competitiveness and efficiency will not be compromised. We have nearly finalised the package and there will not be any problem for Air India. Within this month yes. Certainly,"" Choubey told reporters here.

He was responding to a query about the revival package for Air India.

He said the disinvestment of Air India may be possible only after the macroeconomic conditions and market conditions are favourable and expected that the airlines would improve its efficiency and operational capabilities.


The official further said the rising fuel prices and sliding Rupee against Dollar, impacted the profitability of the industry during the past two quarters and the ministry was also working separately on various measures to support the airlines sector in general.


""The intention is to bring down the cost. You must appreciate that the cost of operations has gone up because the rental has gone up on account of devaluation of Rupee and fuel prices have also led to the cost increase in operations.



So our intention is to bring down the cost. Thats what we are wanting to provide,"" he said.

Sunil Bhaskaran, who is currently vice president of corporate affairs at Tata Steel, has been chosen to head the airline - a joint venture between India's autos-to-steel conglomerate Tata Sons and Malaysian low-cost carrier AirAsia Group Bhd.

AirAsia India did not immediately respond to a request for comment. Bhaskaran could not immediately be reached.


AirAsia India has seen several high-profile exits in recent months and has been without a CEO for nearly six months. Bhaskaran's appointment would also come at a time when the airline and some of its executives are being investigated for alleged wrongdoing.


Indian police in May filed a case against AirAsia Group, CEO Tony Fernandes and its domestic entity AirAsia India, over allegations of corruption and breaking rules in obtaining a flying licence.

The Central Bureau of Investigation (CBI) accused the airline, some of its employees and third parties of violating India's foreign direct investment rules while obtaining the licence, and of allegedly bribing government officials in an attempt to get regulations relaxed to allow AirAsia India to fly international routes.


AirAsia India has refuted the allegations of wrongdoing.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/airasia-india-likely-to-appoint-sunil-bhaskaran-as-new-chief-sources/articleshow/66149596.cms"
"72","Air India makes part payment after oil companies threaten to cut fuel supply","NEW DELHI: Air India's domestic passengers out of eight major cities, including some state capitals, have been spared major flight disruptions. Oil companies on Monday morning told AI that they will not supply jet fuel to aircraft of AI group -- AI, AI Express and Alliance Air -- from 4 pm on Monday due to mounting dues. However after getting some payment, they reportedly did not cut the supplies as threatened at: Mohali (Chandigarh), Patna, Pune, Trivandrum, Jaipur, Lucknow, Visakhapatnam and Coimbatore.
""AI was to pay about Rs 100 crore to the oil marketing companies (OMC) on Monday morning as payment for fuel uplifted over the weekend. When they did not get the same by afternoon, the stop-supply order for right places was issued. But after 1 pm they got the payment and our aircraft are getting fuel without any disruption,"" said a senior AI official.


Indian Oil's marketing division at Coimbatore Airport sent an order to AI station head there saying: ""We have been instructed by our head office that OMCs have decided to suspend supplies to all domestic flights of Air India group at 8 locations (from) October 8, 4 pm. This is for kind information.""


AI owes about Rs 4,200 crore to OMCs as dues and current outstanding in credit period. Almost every service or goods provider to AI is seeking it's dues. Whether this includes aircraft lessors, oil companies and airport operators.



The government is yet to infuse funds into AI as per promised schedule and the delay is causing severe hardships in daily operations. Aviation secretary R N Choubey said: ""All these issues are being taken care of. AI will get funds to meet all its requirements. This ATF issue is being resolved.""


The government is to give Rs 2,000 equity to AI. Pending that, it has given sovereign guarantee of Rs 3,000 crore to the airline to allow it to take raise of that amount from banks. AI is learnt to have raised Rs 2,500 crore loan and will raise another Rs 500 crore shortly, say sources.","https://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/business/india-business/air-india-makes-part-payment-after-oil-companies-threaten-to-cut-fuel-supply/articleshow/66122150.cms"
